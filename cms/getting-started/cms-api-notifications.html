  <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
  
  <p>You can receive notifications when <code translate="No">video-change</code> events occur in your video library. Notifications will be sent to the URL you specify, which should point to an application capable of handling <span translate="No">HTTP</span> <code translate="No">POST</code> requests.</p>
  
  <h3>Authentication</h3>
  
  <p>Like all requests to the CMS API, requests to set up or list notification subscriptions must be authenticated using an <a href="/oauth/guides/getting-access-tokens.html">access token</a>. The client credentials used to get the access token must have permissions for <code translate="No">video-cloud/notifications/all</code> (<strong translate="No">CMS-&gt;Notifications</strong> if you use the <a href="https://studio.support.brightcove.com/admin/managing-api-authentication-credentials.html">Studio UI</a> to create the credentials.)</p>
  
  <h3>Setup</h3>
  
  <p>You can specify up to 10 endpoints to receive notifications by making a <code translate="No">POST</code> request to <code class="language-http" translate="No">https://cms.api.brightcove.com/v1/accounts/{account_id}/subscriptions</code> and including JSON in the request body like this:</p>
  
  <pre class="line-numbers">
        <code class="language-json" translate="No">{
        "endpoint":"http://solutions.brightcove.com/bcls/di-api/di-callbacks.php",
        "events":["video-change"]
        }
        </code>
        </pre>
  
  <p>Notifications are sent in JSON format. Here's an example:</p>
  
  <pre class="line-numbers">
        <code class="language-json" translate="No">{"timestamp":1423840514446,
        "account_id":"775205503001",
        "event":"video-change",
        "video":"4020894387001",
        "version":26}
        </code>
        </pre>
  
  <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">There is currently no other way to subscribe to notifications except through the API.</aside>
  
  <h3>Notification fields</h3>
  
  <table class="bcls-table">
    <thead class="bcls-table__head">
      <tr>
        <th>Item</th>
        <th>Description</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody class="bcls-table__body">
      <tr>
        <td ><code translate="No">timestamp</code></td>
        <td >time when the event occurred in <span translate="No">Epoch</span> milliseconds</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td ><code translate="No">account_id</code></td>
        <td >the <span translate="No">Video Cloud</span> account id</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td ><code translate="No">event</code></td>
        <td >the type of event - currently this will always be <code translate="No">video-change</code></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td ><code translate="No">video</code></td>
        <td >the video ID</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td ><code translate="No">version</code></td>
        <td >the version of the video - each set of change events increments the video version - for example, creation of a new set of renditions would constitute a set of change events</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
  
  <p>Requests to create a subscription will receive an <span translate="No">HTTP 422</span> error response for the following conditions:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>The <code translate="No">endpoint</code> or <code translate="No">events</code> field is missing from the request body</li>
    <li>The <code translate="No">events</code> field value is not a list (array)</li>
    <li>The subscription defined already exists</li>
    <li>You already have 10 subscriptions to this event</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>Notification failures</h3>
  
  <p>The notification system treats any <code translate="No">4xx</code> or <code translate="No">5xx</code> return from the customer server as a retry-able failure. Failing callbacks will be retried up to 20 times, with an exponentially increasing delay between subsequent callbacks. The first few retries will happen within minutes of the initial callback attempt. If the callback continues failing, and we get all the way out to the 20th retry, the retry delay will be a few days.</p>
  
  <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">&gt;Notes:
  <ul>
    <li><code translate="No">video-change</code> events are triggered by automated system processes as well as user actions, so these events will not always corresponds to changes you made to video properties in Studio or via the APIs.</li>
    <li>Notification handlers on servers built on HTTP2 are not currently supported. Notifications sent to HTTP2 servers may fail to be delivered without returning any error.</li>
  </ul>
  </aside>
  
  <h3>Firewalls</h3>
  
  <p>In case your organization has a strict policy regarding sources of incoming traffic through your firewall, we allow the AWS us-east-1/Virginia IPs. This is subject to change, so all AWS IPs should be whitelisted. See <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-ip-ranges.html">http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-ip-ranges.html</a> for more information.</p>
  
  <h3>Endpoint for notification subscriptions</h3>
  
  <pre class="line-numbers">
        <code class="language-http" translate="No">/accounts/{account_id}/subscriptions
        </code>
        </pre>
  
  <h3 id="createSubscription">Create a new subscription</h3>
  
  <p>To create a new subscription, submit a <code translate="No">POST</code> request with a request body including the endpoint that you want notifications delivered to and <code translate="No">video-change</code> as the single item in an <code translate="No">events</code> array:</p>
  
  <pre class="line-numbers">
        <code class="language-json" translate="No">{ "endpoint": "http://solutions.brightcove.com:9002", "events": [ "video-change" ] }
        </code>
        </pre>
  
  <h3 id="getSubscriptions">Get a list of your subscriptions</h3>
  
  <p>To get a list of all your subscriptions, send a <code translate="No">GET</code> request to the subscriptions endpoint.</p>
  
  <h3 id="getSubscription">Get or Delete a single subscription</h3>
  
  <p>Use the following endpoint to get or delete a single subscription:</p>
  
  <h4>Endpoint</h4>
  
  <pre class="line-numbers">
        <code class="language-http" translate="No">/accounts/{account_id}/subscriptions/{subscription_id}
        </code>
        </pre>
  
  <p>A <code translate="No">GET</code> request will retrieve the subscription. A <code translate="No">DELETE</code> request will delete the subscription. You cannot update a subscription at this time. If you want to modify a subscription, you will need to delete it and create a new one.</p>
  </section>
  
  <section class="bcls-section">
  <h2 id="What_triggers">What triggers notifications?</h2>
  
  <p><code translate="No">video-change</code> events are triggered by any change in the video metadata. This includes any change to the video made in Studio or through a <span translate="No">CMS API</span> write method. There are also system events that will trigger <code translate="No">video-change</code> events.</p>
  
  <p>Changes that will trigger an event include:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>A video is created</li>
    <li>Ingestion of video or asset file starts</li>
    <li>Ingestion of video or asset file is completed</li>
    <li>Encoding of a new rendition finishes</li>
    <li>A poster image is created</li>
    <li>A thumbnail image is created</li>
    <li>A video is deleted</li>
    <li>Video metadata is changed (by the system or a user)</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>Notes</h3>
  
  <p>Retranscoding a video will not trigger a <code translate="No">video-change</code> event unless the resulting rendition set is different.</p>
  
  <p>There are system events that occur after a video is deleted, so you will receive notifications about a video after deleting it.</p>
  
  <p>What will <strong>not</strong> trigger a <code translate="No">video-change</code> event is a change to a video asset that does not change the video metadata. For example, if you replace a remote text track file or image, but the URL recorded in the video metadata remains the same, no <code translate="No">video-change</code> event will occur, and no notification will be sent.</p>
