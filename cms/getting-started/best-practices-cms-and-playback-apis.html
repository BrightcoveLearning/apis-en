  <p>Both the CMS and Playback APIs provide access to your Video Cloud video data. The purpose of this topic is to help you understand the difference between them and the best practices for using them.</p>

  <h2 id="differences_between">Differences between the CMS and Playback APIs</h2>
  
  <p>The CMS and Playback APIs access the same underlying video data. There are some key differences between them that should determine which one you use in particular situations, however.</p>
  
  <p>Generally speaking, the CMS API is intended for backend use, such as integrating Video Cloud with your CMS system. The Playback API is intended for frontend use to fetch video and playlist data for players or video portals (the Brightcove Player <code>catalog</code> and <code>playlist</code> APIs use the Playback API, for example).</p>
  
  <p>The table below lists some key differences between the two APIs.</p>

  <h2 id="using_media_urls">Using Media URLs</h2>
  
  <p>It is important to understand that URLs for renditions, images, and other assets are not fixed. Brightcove reconfigures the storage of media assets from time to time, and when this happens, URLs for specific assets will change. If you are relying on hard-coded URLs to these assets in your pages or apps, the links will break at some point.</p>
  
  <p>In addition, all URLs contain a <code>TTL</code> token for content security reasons. This means that the URLs expire after 6 hours by default. The life of the token can be extended up to 365 days - if you want longer-lived tokens, <a href="https://help.brightcove.com/en/contact">Contact Brightcove Support</a>. Be aware, however, that the <code>TTL</code> reflects the maximum time that asset will be cached by the CDN, but is not a guarantee that the URL will not change before the token expires.</p>
  
  <p>The best way to prevent links to media from breaking is to retrieve them from Video Cloud at runtime using the <a href="/node/18019">CMS API</a> or the <a href="/node/18380">Playback API</a>.</p>
  
  <section class="bcls-subsection">
  <h3>Caching URLs</h3>
  
  <p>If a runtime API request is not an option, then we recommend getting the URL(s) from a local data cache that is refreshed at least once a day, or within the time-to-live set for your <code>TTL</code> tokens, whichever is shorter.</p>

  <h2 id="reference_id_conflicts">Reference id conflicts</h2>
  
  <p>This section applies to the CMS API only.</p>
  
  <p>To insure the uniqueness of reference ids, the CMS API locks the id for up to 3 minutes after any operation on the video it is assigned to. This can result in 409 errors being returned when you attempt to retry a request that fail too quickly, or when you try to reuse a reference id too soon after deleting the video it was previously assigned to. See the <a href="/node/18022#409_conflict">Error Message Reference</a> for more details.</p>
