title: 'MRSS Feed from Playlist'
description: 'In this sample, you will learn how to use the <span translate="No">CMS API</span> to generate an MRSS feed based on MRSS specification. This sample is similar to the MRSS Generator sample, but in this case we generate the feed from a playlist rather than a collection of videos compiled from a video search.'

    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">This sample and associated code is provided as a guide for your production development. The code is not certified for production use nor officially supported.</aside>

    <p>For the security of your content, the URLs for videos and assets returned by Brightcove APIs are <strong>signed</strong>, meaning that they include a token that is only good for a short time - usually a few hours, but this can vary depending on the account configuration. This means that the URLs in the MRSS code generated by this tool will only be good for the period of time.</p>

    <p>You can deal with this in one of two ways:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>You can ask Brightcove Support to increase the "time-to-live" for the tokens attached to media URLs for your account. The value can be set to any period up to one year. However, be aware that this is an account-level setting and the change will apply to all your videos.</li>
      <li>Alternatively, you can create your own version of this app, and have it create a fresh version of your MRSS feed on a regular basis, within the token life.</li>
    </ul>

        <h2 id="getCredentials">Get credentials</h2>
      </summary>

      <p>To use the <span translate="No">CMS API</span> you will need proper credentials.</p>

      <p>The easiest way to get credentials in most cases is through the Studio Admin API Authentication section (requires admin permissions on your account). See <a href="/general/managing-api-authentication-credentials.html">Managing API Authentication Credentials</a> for details. In most cases, you probably just want to get permissions for all <span translate="No">CMS API</span> operation:</p>

      <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image" alt="CMS API Permissions" src="//learning-services-media.brightcove.com/doc-assets/video-cloud-apis/cms-api/cms-permissions.png" />
        <figcaption class="bcls-caption--image">CMS API Permissions</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>If the permissions you need are not available in Studio, or if you prefer to get them directly from the OAuth API, use your choice of the <strong>Get Client Credentials</strong> documents listed below. Whichever option you choose, you will need to ask for the correct operation permissions. The following can be used with cURL or Postman to get all permissions for the CMS API:</p>

      <pre class="line-numbers">
        <code class="language-json" translate="No">"operations": [
          "video-cloud/video/all",
          "video-cloud/playlist/all",
          "video-cloud/sharing-relationships/all",
          "video-cloud/notifications/all"
        ]</code></pre>

      </summary>

      <p>In order to build your own version the sample app on this page, you must create and host your own proxy. (The proxies used by Brightcove Learning Services only accept requests from Brightcove domains.) A sample proxy, very similar to the one we use, but without the checks that block requests from non-Brightcove domains, can be found in <a href="https://github.com/BrightcoveLearning/sample-proxy-apps">this GitHub repository</a>. You will also find basic instructions for using it there, and a more elaborate guide to building apps around the proxy in <a href="/getting-started/learning-guide-using-rest-apis.html">Using the REST APIs</a>.</p>
