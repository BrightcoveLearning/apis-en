    <h2 id="Introduction">Introduction</h2>
    
    <p>In this sample, you will learn how to share multiple videos from a master account to one or more affiliate accounts using the CMS API.</p>
    
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information language-editable">This sample and associated code is provided as a guide for your production development. The code is not certified for production use nor officially supported.</aside>

    <h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
    
    <ol>
      <li>The response to an API request to share a video will include <strong>all</strong> shares for the video, not just the affiliate(s) indicated in the request. Be aware of this when you look at the responses.</li>
      <li>This app does <strong>NOT</strong> check to see if affiliates have approved the sharing contract. If not, shares will fail.</li>
      <li>This app does <strong>NOT</strong> check to see if a selected video has already been shared with a selected affiliate. If you reshare a video already shared with an affiliate, any metadata changes made by the affiliate will be overwritten.</li>
      <li>This app does <strong>NOT</strong> check for sharing errors. Sharing may fail because of custom field mismatches between the master and affiliate account, or other reasons. Look at the responses to the video share requests to see if there are any errors.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>The last three limitations above can be removed by adding additional code to your own version of this app. We have not added the code in the interest of keeping the sample app logic as simple to understand as possible.</p>

    <h2 id="requirements_to_run_app">Requirements to use this app</h2>
    
    <p>In order to use this app, you will need to get some prerequisites in place:</p>
    
    <ol>
      <li>The <strong>master</strong> account must be enabled for media sharing - if it is not, contact your account manager or Brightcove Support</li>
      <li>You must have client credentials for the master account that enabled for media sharing operations (see the <a href="#getCredentials">Get credentials</a> section below)</li>
      <li>You must have a <code>default</code> channel (this channel is set up automatically when media sharing is enabled for your account)</li>
      <li>You must have one or more <strong>affiliates</strong> added to the channel - if you have not done that, you can do it in <a href="/node/18459">Studio</a> or by using this <a href="/node/18479">companion app for adding multiple affiliates</a>.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Here are some tips to effectively use the above CodePen:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Toggle the actual display of the player by clicking the <strong>Result</strong> button.</li>
      <li>Click the <strong>HTML/CSS/JS</strong> buttons to display ONE of the code types.</li>

    <h2 id="proxy">Proxy code</h2>
    
    <p>In order to build your own version the sample app on this page, you must create and host your own proxy. (The proxies used by Brightcove Learning Services only accept requests from Brightcove domains.) A sample proxy, very similar to the one we use, but without the checks that block requests from non-Brightcove domains, can be found in <a href="https://github.com/BrightcoveLearning/sample-proxy-apps">this GitHub repository</a>. You will also find basic instructions for using it there, and a more elaborate guide to building apps around the proxy in <a href="/getting-started/learning-guide-using-rest-apis.html">Using the REST APIs</a>.</p>
