    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">This sample and associated code is provided as a guide for your production development. The code is not certified for production use nor officially supported.</aside>

    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note that this app was built to help Brightcove customers migrate from the old Smart Player to the new Brightcove Player. It was built around videos added using the legacy ingest system, and does not return meaningful results for Dynamic Delivery videos.</aside>

    <p>This tool generates a report that includes the following:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Summary showing how many videos have <strong>no</strong> HLS or MP4 renditions or both</li>
      <li>Report for each video showing the HLS and MP4 (HTTP) renditions (with the bitrate range and frame size for each)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The aim is to help you get ready to migrate from the Smart Player to the Brightcove Player by identifying videos that need to be transcoded to create HLS and/or MP4 renditions.</p>

    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note that Dynamic Delivery videos are not checked, as there is no need to.</aside>

        <h2 id="obtaincredentials">Obtain credentials</h2>
      </summary>

      <p>Like most of Brightcove's RESTful APIs, the <span translate="No">CMS API</span> requires OAuth access tokens to authorize requests. In order to get access tokens, you first need to obtain client credentials with permissions for kinds of operations you want to request.</p>

      <ol>
        <li>To obtain your credentials follow the instructions in <a href="https://studio.support.brightcove.com/admin/managing-api-authentication-credentials.html">Managing API Credentials</a>. This is the recommended way of obtaining your client credentials. This sample only requires <code translate="No">Video Read</code> permissions, but in most cases, you will likely want to get all permissions:

          <p>You can also obtain credentials using the OAuth API, following the instructions in one of the guides listed below:</p>
        </li>
      </ol>

    <p>You can use the app below to generate a report on the renditions for all videos in your account. Videos with no HLS or HTTP MP4 (progressive download) renditions will need to be retranscoded to work well in the new player. Videos with only low bitrate HLS renditions should be retranscoded as well.</p>

      <p>Here are some tips to effectively use the above CodePen:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Toggle the actual display of the app by clicking the <strong>Result</strong> button.</li>
        <li>Click the <strong>HTML/CSS/JS</strong> buttons to display ONE of the code types.</li>
        <li>Click <strong>Edit on CodePen</strong> in the upper right corner to fork this CodePen into your own account.</li>

      </summary>

      <p>In order to build your own version the sample app on this page, you must create and host your own proxy. (The proxies used by Brightcove Learning Services only accept requests from Brightcove domains.) A sample proxy, very similar to the one we use, but without the checks that block requests from non-Brightcove domains, can be found in <a href="https://github.com/BrightcoveLearning/sample-proxy-apps">this GitHub repository</a>. You will also find basic instructions for using it there, and a more elaborate guide to building apps around the proxy in <a href="/getting-started/learning-guide-using-rest-apis.html">Using the REST APIs</a>.</p>
