  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="original_filename_gets_corrupted">Original filename gets corrupted</h2>
    <p>In some cases, the <code>original_filename</code> field for videos gets corrupted and will not contain the real filename.</p>
  </section>
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="Tags_may_not_contain_commas">Tags may not contain commas</h2>
    <p>If you attempt to add a tag to a video that contains a comma (e.g. "SomeCo, Inc") the request will fail with an "illegal tag" error.</p>
  </section>
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="Scheduled_videos">Scheduled videos</h2>
    <p>Because the Playback API and Player Catalog cache videos for up to 10-15 minutes, a player requesting a video scheduled to become available during the next few minutes (up to 20), may not be able to get a playable video until the cache refreshes.</p>

  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="Has_digital_master">Has digital master</h2>
    <p>If you are using this field to test whether a video can be retranscoded, it is not reliable for shared videos, as it will be true if the original video has a master, but still cannot be retranscoded by the affiliate account.</p>
    <h3>Workaround</h3>
    <p>If videos are shared to the account, you need to test for both <code>has_digital_master === true</code> and <code>sharing.by_external_account === false</code>. Sample code (JavaScript):</p>
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-javascript">var video={some_video_object}
if (video.sharing !== null) {
  if (video.sharing.by_external_account === false) {
    if (video.has_digital_master) {
    // video can be retranscoded
    }
  }
}</code></pre>
  </section>
