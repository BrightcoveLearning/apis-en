    <h2 id="Introduction">Introduction</h2>
    
    <p>Playlists for an account can be searched by providing a <code class="notranslate">q</code> parameter to the above call similarly to the provided Video Search functionality. Be aware, however, that <a href="#fields">a much smaller number of fields can be searched</a>, and that only the playlist properties are searched, not properties of the videos contained in the playlist.</p>
    
    <p>Any unqualified/default terms will search for any text match in the name, reference_id, or id field of a Playlist, for example a search for <code class="notranslate">?q=news+2016</code> would match any of the following if they exist:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>A Playlist with a name of <code class="notranslate">Exciting 2016 News</code></li>
      <li>A Playlist with an id of 2016</li>
      <li>A Playlist with a <code class="notranslate">reference_id</code> of <code class="notranslate">news 2016</code></li>
    </ul>
    
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information"><code class="notranslate">+</code> is used as an encoded space in the examples (not a literal "+")</aside>
    
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Requests to the CMS API require an authorization header which contain your access tokens. For details on how to obtain client credentials and use them to retrieve access tokens, see the <a href="/node/17928">Brightcove OAuth Overview</a>.</aside>
    
    <p>As implied above multiple terms provided are <code class="notranslate">OR</code>'ed together, and strings containing one or more of the provided terms will be returned. Provided values are <a href="#stemming">stemmed</a>, so variations on the words will be matched. Prefix matching is <strong>not</strong> currently supported. So for instance a search for <code class="notranslate">p*</code> will not return results starting with "p" nor will a search for <code class="notranslate">play*</code> return results containing "playlist".</p>

    <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="Ignored_words">Ignored words</h2>
    
    <p>Certain words are ignored in search strings because they are so common that they are likely to return many results unrelated to what you are actually searching for. Below is a list of words that are ignored by search:</p>
    
    <p>"a", "an", "and", "are", "as", "at", "be", "but", "by", "for", "if", "in", "into", "is", "it", "no", "not", "of", "on", "or", "such", "that", "the", "their", "then", "there", "these", "they", "this", "to", "was", "will", "with"</p>
    </section>
    
    <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="fields">Fields</h2>
    
    <p>Specific fields can be queried by using the <code class="notranslate">{field:}{value}</code> syntax such as <code class="notranslate">?q=news+2016+type:EXPLICIT</code>. Fields provided this way must match exactly. Like other terms these will be <code class="notranslate">OR</code>'ed.</p>
    
    <p>The following fields are currently supported:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>type</li>
      <li>name</li>
      <li>description</li>
      <li>reference_id</li>
    </ul>
    
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">For an explanation of the fields, see the <a href="/node/18024">Playlist Fields Reference</a>.</aside>
    </section>
    
    <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="required_terms">Required terms</h2>
    
    <p>You can require terms by prefixing them with a URI-encoded <code class="notranslate">+</code> sign (%2B) - example: <code class="notranslate">q=name:%2Bnews+%2B2016</code> (which would return only playlists with names including both "news" and "2016").</p>
    
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--warning">You cannot combine optional and required terms - if you search on <code class="notranslate">q=name:news+%2B2016</code>, the <code class="notranslate">%2B</code> in front of "2016" will be ignored, and all playlists with names containing "news" OR "2016" will be returned.</aside>
    </section>
    
    <section id="excluded_terms" class="bcls-section">
    <h2>Excluded terms</h2>
    
    <p>Prefix terms with a URI-encoded <code class="notranslate">-</code> sign to exclude playlists with that term. For example: <code class="notranslate">q=name:%2Bnews+%2D2016</code> will return videos that have names containing "news" but <strong>not</strong> containing "2016".</p>
    </section>
    
    <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="stemming">Stemming</h2>
    
    <p><em>Stemming</em> refers to storing and searching for the roots of words. What this means is that the terms "play", "playing", "plays", "played"... will all be stored as "play" and when a search is done for any of those terms the search will accordingly be translated to search for "play". Stem only applies to the root of the word, and not a string that begins or is part of the word. Therefore, a search on <code class="notranslate">name:play</code> will returned videos with names containing "play", "played", "playing", and "playable", but will not return videos with names that contain "display" or "playlist".</p>
