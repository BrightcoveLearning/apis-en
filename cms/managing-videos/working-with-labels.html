    <p>Labels are similar to tags, but they have some distinct advantages:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Labels are created at the account level, and applied to videos.
        <p>This is important particularly if your purpose is to organize your video library.For example, if you are trying organize your videos using tags, you might create tags like <code>birds</code>, <code>fish</code>, and <code>insects</code>. Then it's easy to search and find all your bird videos and create a smart playlist for them. But if a user adding a new video accidentally types <code>bird</code> instead of <code>birds</code>, you now have a new tag, and the video does not belong to your <code>birds</code> collection.</p>
        <p>If you create a label called <code>birds</code> instead, only that label can be added to a video. You can't accidentally add the non-existent label <code>birds</code> instead.</p>
