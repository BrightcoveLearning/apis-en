    <p>Playlists allow you to group a set of related videos together so that they can be loaded into a player and watched as a group. The <span translate="No">CMS API</span> contains a set of write methods you can use to create, update, or delete playlists:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li><a href="#create">Create a playlist</a></li>
      <li><a href="#update">Update a playlist</a></li>
      <li><a href="#delete">Delete a playlist</a></li>
    </ul>
    
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">These tasks can also be performed in the Studio Media module.</aside>

    <h2>Authentication</h2>
    
    <p class="BCL-aside">Requests to the <span translate="No">CMS API</span> require an authorization header which contain your access tokens.

    <p>There is one <code translate="No">EXPLICIT</code> (manual) playlist type for which you specify the videos to be included as an array of video ids. There are also seven smart playlist types - the smart playlist types differ in how they order a set of videos that are selected dynamically using a search string. The table below shows all the playlist types.</p>

    <h2 id="Search_field">Search field</h2>
    
    <p>For all the smart playlist types, the collection of videos is assembled dynamically based on the <code translate="No">search</code> field value for the playlist. The search field value must be a valid search string for a tag <a href="/cms/searching/cms-and-playback-apis-video-search-v2.html">search string</a> for the CMS API. Below are some examples with explanations of the videos they will return.</p>

    <h2 id="get_count_of_videos">Get count of videos</h2>
    
    <p>You can get a count of the videos in a playlist (either smart or manual) using the <code translate="No">counts</code> endpoint:</p>
    
    <pre class="line-numbers">
    <code class="language-http notranslate">https://cms.api.brightcove.com/v1/accounts/<span class="bcls-input">account_id</span>/playlists/<span class="bcls-input">playlist_id</span>/videos</code></pre>

    </section>
    
    <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="create">Create a playlist</h2>
    
    <p>To create a new playlist, you make a <code translate="No">POST</code> request to:</p>
    
    <pre class="line-numbers">
    <code class="language-http notranslate">https://cms.api.brightcove.com/v1/accounts/<span class="bcls-input">{account_id}</span>/playlists</code></pre>
    
    <h3>Request body</h3>
    
    <p>You can include many (but not all!) of the video metadata fields in your request. You <strong>must</strong> include at least a <code translate="No">name</code> and <code translate="No">type</code> for the playlist. Below are two examples, one creating an EXPLICIT playlist, the second creating a smart playlist of type ACTIVATED_NEWEST_TO_OLDEST, including videos that have two tags:</p>
    
    <h4>For EXPLICIT playlist</h4>
    
    <pre class="line-numbers">
    <code class="language-json notranslate">{
      "type": "EXPLICIT",
      "name": "My manual playlist",
      "video_ids": [

        "5289693763001",
        "5289680417001",
        "5288472314001"
      ]
    }</code></pre>
    
    <h4>For smart playlist</h4>
    
    <pre class="line-numbers">
    <code class="language-json notranslate">{
      "type": "ACTIVATED_NEWEST_TO_OLDEST",
      "name": "My smart playlist",
      "search": "+tags:bird-tags:sea"
    }</code></pre>
    
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note that all playlists have a limit of 100 videos, but you can set that limit lower for smart playlists by using the <code translate="No">limit</code> field.</aside>
    
    <p>See the <a href="/cms/references/reference.html#api-playlistGroup-Create_Playlist">API Reference</a> for all fields that can be used in creating playlists.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="update">Update a playlist</h2>
    
    <p>Updating a playlist is very similar to creating one. The only differences are the request method ( <code translate="No">PATCH</code> instead of POST) and the playlist id appended to the URL. The fields for the request body are exactly the same.</p>
    
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note that you <strong>cannot</strong> change an <code translate="No">EXPLICIT</code> playlist to another type, or change another type of playlist to <code translate="No">EXPLICIT</code>.</aside>

    <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="delete">Delete a playlist</h2>
    
    <p>To delete a playlist, make a request using the <code translate="No">DELETE</code> method to:</p>

    <code class="language-http notranslate">https://cms.api.brightcove.com/v1/accounts/<span class="bcls-input">account_id</span>/playlists/<span class="bcls-input">playlist_id</span></code></pre>
    
    <p>(This is the same URL used to update a playlist.)</p>
