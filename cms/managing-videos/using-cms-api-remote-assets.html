    <p>In the following sections, we'll look at each of these steps.</p>

    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--tip">
      <p>For all requests to the asset endpoints, you can specify the video you are operating on by <strong>id</strong>
        or <strong>reference_id</strong>:</p>

      <pre class="line-numbers">
        <code class="language-http"
          translate="No">https://cms.api.brightcove.com/v1/accounts/{{account_id}}/videos/{{video_id}}/assets/...

        </code>
      </pre>
    </aside>
  </section>

  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="creatVideo">Create the video</h2>

    <p>Before you can add remote assets, you must create a video object in your Video Cloud media library, using POST
      request to:</p>

    <pre class="line-numbers">
      <code class="language-http" translate="No">https://cms.api.brightcove.com/v1/accounts/{{account_id}}/videos
      </code>
    </pre>

    <p>In the request body, include a JSON object that minimally contains the video name, but may contain additional
      metadata:</p>

    <pre class="line-numbers">
      <code class="language-json" translate="No">{
        "name": "My Remote Video",
        "description": "A short description of the video",
        "tags": ["remote", "fall_campaign"],
        "reference_id": "myUniqueReferenceID"
        }
      </code>
    </pre>

    <p>For details of the create video operation, see the <a
        href="/cms/references/reference.html#operation/CreateVideo">API Reference</a>.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="addRenditions">Add Renditions</h2>

    <p>Next, add one or more full-length remote video renditions by making a POST request to:</p>

    <pre class="line-numbers">
      <code class="language-http"
        translate="No">https://cms.api.brightcove.com/v1/accounts/{{account_id}}/videos/{{video_id}}/assets/renditions
      </code>
    </pre>

    <p>The JSON in the request body must contain minimally the remote url, but may contain other metadata for the
      rendition:</p>

    <pre class="line-numbers">
      <code class="language-json" translate="No">{
        "video_duration": 31487,
        "name": "RA - Great Blue Heron",
        "remote_url": "//some.site.com/videos/mp4/greatblueheron.mp4",
        "encoding_rate": 983000,
        "frame_height": 360,
        "size": 3887659,
        "frame_width": 640,
        "video_codec": "h264",
        "video_container": "MP4",
        "progressive_download": true
        }
      </code>
    </pre>

    <h3>Notes</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>Use this endpoint only for adding full length video renditions (typically an .mp4 or .mov file) - for adding
        segmented streams like HLS or DASH, use the manifest endpoints described in the next section.</li>
      <li>
        <p>Video Cloud does not inspect the remote video files, so providing additional metadata will enable Video Cloud
          to display this information in Studio (or in the Brightcove player, if you configure the player to display the
          metadata).</p>

        <p>For details of the add rendition operation, see the <a
            href="/cms/references/reference.html#operation/AddRendition">API Reference</a>.</p>
      </li>
      <li>Renditions for remote assets must have the <code translate="No">video_codec </code> and <code
          translate="No">video_container </code> fields to work properly.</li>
      <li>MP4 renditions <strong>must</strong> have the <code translate="No">"progressive_download": true </code> field
        set to work properly in the Brightcove player</li>
      <li>Mixed assets are not allowed - you cannot add a remote rendition to an ingested video</li>
      <li>If your CDN or other remote repository supports both HTTP and HTTPS delivery, then specify the URL for remote
        assets with a <strong>protocol-neutral URL</strong> as shown in the example above (i.e. use
        "//my.domain/path/..." instead of "https://my.domain/path/...")</li>
    </ol>
  </section>

  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="addManifests">Add manifests</h2>

    <p>Note that to add remote segmented types such as DASH and HLS renditions, you only need to create the video and
      then add the manifests - you do <strong>not</strong> need to "add renditions" as explained in the previous
      section.</p>

    <p>In addition to adding full length renditions, you can also add manifests for segmented renditions such as HLS,
      HDS, and ISM, by making a POST request to the endpoint for the manifest type:</p>

    <pre class="line-numbers">
      <code class="language-http"
        translate="No">https://cms.api.brightcove.com/v1/accounts/{{account_id}}/videos/{{video_id}}/assets/hls_manifest
        https://cms.api.brightcove.com/v1/accounts/{{account_id}}/videos/{{video_id}}/assets/hds_manifest
        https://cms.api.brightcove.com/v1/accounts/{{account_id}}/videos/{{video_id}}/assets/ism_manifest
        https://cms.api.brightcove.com/v1/accounts/{{account_id}}/videos/{{video_id}}/assets/ismc_manifest
        https://cms.api.brightcove.com/v1/accounts/{{account_id}}/videos/{{video_id}}/assets/dash_manifests
      </code>
    </pre>

    <p>In the request body JSON, provide the remote url and a name (optional):</p>

    <pre class="line-numbers">
      <code class="language-json" translate="No">{
        "remote_url": "https://some.site.com/avideo/hls/chickadee/chickadee.m3u8",
        "name": "chickadee_hls"
        }
      </code>
    </pre>

    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">You can add one manifest of each kind. For the segmented type to
      be playable, you must install the appropriate plugin for the Brightcove player, and additional browser plugins may
      be required for some browsers.</aside>

    <p>For details of using the add manifest operations, consult the relevant section of the API Reference:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="/cms/references/reference.html#operation/AddHlsManifest">Add HLS Manifest</a></li>
      <li><a href="/cms/references/reference.html#operation/AddHdsManifest">Add HDS Manifest</a></li>
      <li><a href="/cms/references/reference.html#operation/AddIsmManifest">Add ISM Manifest</a></li>

    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="addImages">Add poster/thumbnail</h2>

    <p>You can add a remote poster and thumbnail to your video by making POST requests to these endpoints:</p>

    <pre class="line-numbers">
      <code class="language-http"
        translate="No">https://cms.api.brightcove.com/v1/accounts/{{account_id}}/videos/{{video_id}}/assets/poster
        https://cms.api.brightcove.com/v1/accounts/{{account_id}}/videos/{{video_id}}/assets/thumbnail
      </code>
    </pre>

    <p>In the request body JSON, you must include the remote url for the image, and you can add a name if you like:</p>

    <pre class="line-numbers">
      <code class="language-json" translate="No">{
        "remote_url": "https://some.site.com/images/great-blue-heron-poster.png"
        }
      </code>
    </pre>

    <p>For details of the operations, see the API Reference:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="/cms/references/reference.html#operation/AddPoster">Add Poster</a></li>
      <li><a href="/cms/references/reference.html#operation/AddThumbnail">Add Thumbnail</a></li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="addTextTracks">Add text tracks</h2>

    <p>Text tracks can be used to add captions, chapters, and other time-based metadata to your video.</p>

    <p><strong>Unlike renditions and images, text tracks are treated the same for remote asset videos as for videos
        ingested into the Video Cloud system.</strong> To actually add the text tracks to a video, you must use the
      Media module in Studio or the <span translate="No">CMS API</span> <a href="#api-Video-Update_Video">Update Video
        operation</a>.</p>

    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Text tracks (WebVTT files) are supported in the Brightcove Player.
      To add captions for the old Smart Player, see <a href="#addCaptions">Add Captions</a>.</aside>
  </section>

  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="Replace_remote_with_VOD">Replace remote with ingested</h2>

    <p>You can replace a remote asset video with an ingested one by making a request to the Dynamic Ingest API:</p>

    <pre class="line-numbers">
      <code class="language-http"
        translate="No">https://ingest.api.brightcove.com/v1/accounts/{{account_id}}/videos/{{video_id}}/ingest-requests
      </code>
    </pre>

    <p>The simplest request body would look like this:</p>

    <pre class="line-numbers">
      <code class="language-json" translate="No">{
        "master": {
        "url": "https://host/master.mp4"
        }
        }
      </code>
    </pre>

    <p>See the <a
        href="/dynamic-ingest/references/reference.html#operation/AccountsVideosIngestRequestsByAccountIdAndVideoIdPost">Dynamic
        Ingest API Reference</a> for additional options and information.</p>

    <p>One of the common uses of remote asset videos is to create a placeholder video for use in a live streaming event.
      Once the event is complete, you may wish to replace the "live" video with a video-on-demand recording of the event
      that appears in the same player you used for the live stream. You can do this by using the method described above,
      though it can also be used to turn any remote asset video into one that is ingested into Video Cloud.</p>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Please note that <strong>Live</strong> supports only HLS and
      <strong>On Demand</strong> supports HLS, MP4, and DASH.
    </aside>
  </section>

  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="modifyAssets">Modify assets</h2>

    <p>In addition to adding remote assets for a video, there are also operations for retrieving, updating, and deleting
      the asset information. These operations use the endpoints described above, but with GET, PATCH, or DELETE
      requests. For update and delete requests, you must add the asset id (which is included in the response to POST and
      GET requests) to request URL:</p>

    <pre class="line-numbers">
      <code class="language-http"
        translate="No">https://cms.api.brightcove.com/v1/accounts/{{account_id}}/videos/{{video_id}}/assets<strong>/{asset_type}/{asset_id}</strong>
      </code>
    </pre>

    <p>See the <a href="/cms/references/reference.html#tag/Media-Assets">API Reference</a> for details of the get,
      update, and delete operations.</p>
  </section>
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
    <li>SSAI is not supported for remote assets.</li>
    <li>DRM is supported only if you can customize the player to communicate with the DRM license server. This is
      possible with the Brightcove Player through a plugin. For other players, you will need to consult the player
      documentation.</li>
    <li>Analytics: the Brightcove Analytics system depends on system-generated video metadata, such as the video
      duration. Analytics data for remote assets will be less rich unless you can provide this metadata for the remote
      asset.</li>
    <li>Playback guarantee: all videos ingested into Video Cloud can be played back in the Brightcove Player. This is
      true for almost all remote assets, but there are some edge cases where videos may not play. There are a few
      advanced features of DASH and HLS that we do not yet support for example. For non-Brightcove players, you will
      need to verify that the video format is fully supported by that player.</li>
