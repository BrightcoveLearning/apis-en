    <p>Generic Stream Concurrency lets you define the number of video streams that a specific user can watch concurrently. Limiting stream concurrency helps you prevent content being stolen or illegally watched through the theft or inappropriate sharing of credentials.</p>
    <p>This feature is part of Playback Restrictions, and itâ€™s an alternative to <a href="/playback-restrictions/guides/stream-concurrency.html">stream concurrency with DRM</a>, which is an alternative solution.</p>

    <h2 id="how_it_works">How it works</h2>
    <h3>Heartbeat</h3>
    <p>The heartbeat is a mechanism that requests on a frequency base the active sessions for a specific user, to enforce that it is a valid session through the entire playback. The heartbeat can be enabled for the Brightcove web player and the native SDK players.</p>
    <p>The frequency of the heartbeat defines how often the player makes mid-stream checks to see if the conditions for playback are still met. By default the frequency is set to 1 minute, but this can be changed.</p>
    <h3>Blocking streams</h3>
    <p>When the maximum number of concurrent streams is reached and the viewer, or someone with their account credentials, tries to open an additional stream, any new stream from that user identified as a different streaming location will be blocked.</p>
    <p>A <strong>correlator identifier</strong> is used to define viewer streaming locations. By default, this correlator identifier will be assigned by the device. However, with a claim in the JWT, this can be overridden. The characteristics of this identifier are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>It should be specific enough to correlate all requests from the same Viewer. If the correlator is too generic it will bucket multiple viewers with the same viewer ID together and group them all into the same slot.</li>
      <li>It should be consistent across all video views for the same Viewer.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When the "correlator" is different, it will try to fill a "slot" for the viewer id, which means if that value changes during the same viewing, it will be treated as if it were a different viewer and prevent playback.</p>

    <h3>Using Brightcove web or SDK players</h3>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist-restart">
      <li>If you wish to change the heartbeat frequency from the default (1 minute) <a href="https://supportportal.brightcove.com/">contact Support</a>.</li>
      <li>
        Create a JWT
        <ul>
        <li>You <strong>must</strong> the concurrency limit and viewer identifier</li>
        <li>You can optionally include a correlator identifier that defines the streaming locations for a viewer</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Enable Generic Stream Concurrency on client players</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Via API</h3>
    <p>This feature can be implemented via API without using the Brightcove Web Player or SDK players. The authorization method is through a JWT.</p>
    <h4>The API endpoints</h4>
    <dl>
      <dt>Heartbeat</dt>
      <dd>
        This endpoint is used to create new streaming sessions.
      </dd>
      <dt>Active sessions</dt>
      <dd>
        This endpoint allows you to list streaming sessions to keep track of them.
      </dd>
      <dt>Stop sessions</dt>
      <dd>
        This endpoint allows you to to stop a streaming session.
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <ul>
      <li>When the maximum number of sessions is exceeded for a viewer, a session will be stopped. It may take as long as the heartbeat frequency for the session to be stopped.</li>
      <li>If the client player cannot to connect to the server, it will re-try three times. It it still cannot connect, playback will be stopped.</li>
    </ul>
