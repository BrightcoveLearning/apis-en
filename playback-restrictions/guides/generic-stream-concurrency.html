    <p>Generic Stream Concurrency lets you define the number of video streams that a specific user can watch concurrently. Limiting stream concurrency helps you prevent content being stolen or illegally watched through the theft or inappropriate sharing of credentials.</p>
    <p>This feature is part of Playback Restrictions, and itâ€™s an alternative to <a href="/playback-restrictions/guides/stream-concurrency.html">stream concurrency with DRM</a>, which is an alternative solution.</p>

    <h3>Heartbeat</h3>
    <p>The heartbeat is a mechanism that requests on a frequency base the active sessions for a specific user, to enforce that it is a valid session through the entire playback. The heartbeat can be enabled for Brightcove web player and the native SDK players.</p>
    <p>The frequency of the heartbeat defines how often the player makes mid-stream checks to see if the conditions for playback are still met. By default the frequency is set to 1 minute, but this can be changed.</p>
