    <h2 id="Introduction">Introduction</h2>
    <p>Brightcove’s Playback Restrictions allow you to define different scenarios for streaming your content. These include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Where your content is available</li>
      <li>How content is streamed</li>
      <li>When content can be viewed</li>
      <li>Who can watch your content</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This feature's flexibility provides the ability to adapt to a number of different use cases.</p>

  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="Asset_level_restrictions">Asset-level restrictions</h2>
    <p>Asset-level restrictions are defined in the <a href="/playback-restrictions/references/reference.html">Playback Rights API</a>.</p>
    <p>You can use Playback Restrictions at the asset level when you want to restrict streaming for the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Region (Geo-restrictions)</li>
      <li>Time (Scheduling)</li>
      <li>Domain</li>
      <li>Proxy type</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Region</h3>
    <p>Geo-restrictions limit where your stream content can be viewed around the world. Options include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>IP addresses</li>
      <li>CIDRs</li>
      <li>Zip Codes (only available for US zip codes)</li>
      <li>DMAs (only availble for US DMAs)</li>
      <li>Countries</li>
    </ul>
    <p>TBD - Geo-restrictions have a global rule which defines the overall behavior as follows:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>When the global rule is set to <strong>Allow All</strong>, you can block streaming to locations using a block list.</li>
      <li>When the global rule is set to <strong>Block All</strong>, you can allow streaming to locations using an allow list.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Time</h3>
    <p>Scheduling allows you to set an availability window to stream your content with two options:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Specific dates</li>
      <li>Recurring for specific days and hours</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Domain</h3>
    <p>Domain restrictions allow you to set domains where you want to allow or block streaming.</p>

    <h3>Proxy</h3>
    <p>Proxy restrictions prevent content streaming when a proxy is in place. There are five available proxy types:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Anonymous</li>
      <li>Public</li>
      <li>Corporate</li>
      <li>Transparent</li>
      <li>Hosting</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Examples</h3>
    <p>Here are some possible use cases:</p>

    <h4>Limit content by zip code</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Goal</p> 
        <p>Shari (Web Producer at Sports League) wants to limit content access by zip code, so that viewers within the sporting event's zip code can not stream the event</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Solution</p> 
        <p>Shari can define Playback Rights to blacklist zip codes per region in the US. Since the content is public (there is no middleware application handling permissions), the Playback Rights need to be set as insecure. When the Playback Rights are defined, Shari will assign these to each media asset.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Limit content by country/IP address</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Goal</p> 
        <p>Dylan (CMO) wants to limit content access by country, so that viewers can stream from anywhere except Ukraine and Korea. Since the development team is located in Korea, Dylan needs to allow streaming from a specific IP address within Korea.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Solution</p> 
        <p>Dylan can define a Playback Right to block the Ukraine and Korea, and add allow an IP address from Korea. Since Dylan’s content is public, every Playback Right needs to allow insecure access. When the Playback Rights are defined, Dylan will assign these to each media asset.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Notes</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>With Playback Rights, content does not need to be encrypted</li>
      <li>By default, a valid token is needed to stream an asset with Playback Rights. But, you can set Playback Rights to not requre a token. </li>
      <li>By default, all assets have a Playback Right that allows streaming to everyone, everywhere, any time</li>
      <li>Each Video Cloud account has up to 100 Playback Rights</li>
      <li>Playback Rights work with Video Cloud/CMS API restrictions (Country and Scheduling). CMS restrictions for an asset are validated before any Playback Rights</li>
      <li>Playback Rights don’t work with Policy Key restrictions (Domain and Geo). When using Playback Rights with the web player or the Native SDKs, the Policy Key is removed. This means that restrictions set with the Policy Key will be ignored.</li>
      <li>Playback Rights can’t be deleted; only enabled or disabled</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Setting asset-level restrictions</h3>
    <p>Asset-level restrictions can be defined by using either:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Brightcove APIs</li>
      <li>Video Cloud Studio</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Brightcove APIs</h4>
    <p>You can use Brightcove's APIs to define asset-level restrictions.</p>
     <ol class="bcls-tasklist-restart">
        <li>
          <p>Use the <a href="/playback-restrictions/references/reference.html">Playback Rights API</a> to create a restriction.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Use the  <a href="/cms/index.html">CMS API</a> to associate the restriction, with your video assets.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Video Cloud Studio</h4>
    <p>You can also use Video Cloud Studio to define asset-level restrictions.</p>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist-restart">
        <li>
          <p>Expand the <strong>ADMIN</strong> dropdown menu, and select <strong>Playback Rights</strong>.</p>
          <figure class="bcls-figure">
            <img
              class="bcls-image--no-border"
              src="/assets/images/playback-restrictions/use-cases/admin.png"
              alt="Video Cloud Studio Admin"
            />
            <figcaption class="bcls-caption--image">Video Cloud Studio Admin</figcaption>
          </figure>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>To create a new restriction, select <strong>New Playback Rights</strong>.</p>
          <figure class="bcls-figure">
            <img
              class="bcls-image--no-border"
              src="/assets/images/playback-restrictions/use-cases/new-right.png"
              alt="New Playback Right"
            />
            <figcaption class="bcls-caption--image">New Playback Right</figcaption>
          </figure>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>To edit a restriction, click on a Playback Right <strong>Name</strong> link.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
   
  </section>

  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="Runtime_restrictions">Runtime restrictions</h2>
    <p>Runtime restrictions are defined in a Jason Web Token (JWT) with specific permissions (claims). This token is sent over every stream request.</p>
    <p>To create the JWT, you can you use middleware (application/service). For details, see the <a href="https://general.support.brightcove.com/developer/create-jwt.html">Creating a JSON Web Token (JWT)</a> document.</p>

    <p>The following restrictions can be set at runtime:</p>
    <h3>Playback Rights</h3>
    <p>You can assign Playback Rights to an asset (see <a href="#Asset_level_restrictions">Asset-level restrictions</a>), or you can set them at runtime using the <code translate="No">prid</code> claim. Runtime restrictions override any asset-level Playback Right.</p>

    <h3>Tags</h3>
     <p>At runtime, you can identify assets with specific tag values to be allowed for streaming. These tags are defined with the <code translate="No">tags</code> claim.</p>

     <h3>List of content</h3>
     <p>Using the <code translate="No">vids</code> claim, you can specify, at runtime, a list of assets to allow for streaming.</p>

     <h3>Specific user-agent</h3>
     <p>To allow streaming from a specific user-agent, use the <code translate="No">ua</code> claim. To use this, your content needs to be encrypted, and you need to set an account flag which requires a JWT on licenses. Contact your account manager to enable this account flag.</p>

     <h3>Concurrency stream limit</h3>
     <p>At runtime, it is possible to limit concurrent streams for a user. For this, the content needs to be encrypted DRM or HLSe. Set the claims as follows:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The <code translate="No">climit</code> claim indicates how many watchers or streams can play at the same time. </li>
          <li>
            The <code translate="No">cbeh</code> claim defines how to block the concurrency. When the stream limit is reached, you can either block a new viewer (meaning a different IP address and device) or block a new stream request (session).
            <ul>
              <li><code translate="No">cbeh</code> value <code translate="No">BLOCK_NEW_USER</code> - Block new viewers</li>
              <li><code translate="No">cbeh</code> value <code translate="No">BLOCK_NEW</code> - Block new streams</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>

      <h3>Device limit</h3>
      <p>At runtime, it is possible to limit the number of streaming devices for a user. For this, the content needs to be encrypted DRM or HLSe. Set the claims as follows:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>For DRM content, the <code translate="No">dlimit</code> claim indicates how many devices a user can stream. Every device from each user requesting a stream is registered. Once the stream limit is reached, no more devices will be able to stream.</li>
          <li>For HLSe content, the <code translate="No">maxip</code> claim defines how many different IP addresses can stream at the same time.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Examples</h3>
    <p>Here are some possible use cases:</p>

    <h4>Allow paid access</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Goal</p> 
        <p>Liz (Event Planner) wants to only allow paid users access to an event's live and VOD content. She also wants to prevent link sharing.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Solution</p> 
        <p>For this use case, every logged user who requests content from the platform needs to have a token with the following claims:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><code translate="No">uid</code> = <code translate="No">"{unique user-id}"</code></li>
          <li><code translate="No">climit</code> = <code translate="No">1</code></li>
          <li><code translate="No">cbeh</code> = <code translate="No">“BLOCK_NEW_USER”</code></li>
        </ul>
        <p>All content (live or VOD) needs to be encrypted with DRM.</p>
        <p>With these permissions, every logged user can stream live or VOD content as long as they are on the same device and network. If the user shares its platform credentials within the timeframe that the token is valid, another user trying to stream any content won’t be able to do it. With the feature's mid-stream checks, Liz can ensure this behavior for the entire content stream.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Block new streams</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Goal</p> 
        <p>Harry (OTT customer) wants to ensure that his platform users are able to view the content, but only one asset at a time.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Solution</p> 
        <p>For Harry's use case, every logged user who requests content from his platform needs to have a valid token with the following claims</p>
        <ul>
          <li><code translate="No">uid</code> = <code translate="No">"{unique user-id}"</code></li>
          <li><code translate="No">climit</code> = <code translate="No">1</code></li>
          <li><code translate="No">cbeh</code> = <code translate="No">“BLOCK_NEW”</code></li>
        </ul>
        <p>All content (live or VOD) needs to be encrypted with DRM.</p>
        <p>The behavior for this case is similar to Liz's use case. The main difference is that Harry’s users won’t be able to watch different assets at the same time while the token is valid. With the feature's mid-stream checks every 5 mins, Harry can ensure this behavior.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Limit concurrent streams</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Goal</p> 
        <p>Shari (Web Producer at Sports League) wants to limit the concurrent streams to 1, for specific content.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Solution</p> 
        <p>For this case, every logged user needs to have a token with the following claims:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><code translate="No">uid</code> = <code translate="No">"{unique user-id}"</code></li>
          <li><code translate="No">vids</code> = <code translate="No">[“{asset 1}”,”{asset 2}”,”{asset 3}” ]</code></li>
          <li><code translate="No">climit</code> = <code translate="No">1</code></li>
          <li><code translate="No">cbeh</code> = <code translate="No">“BLOCK_NEW”</code></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Notes</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>To use the <code translate="No">ua</code>, <code translate="No">maxip</code> and <code translate="No">maxu</code> claims, you need the following:
        <ul>
          <li>Content needs to be encrypted</li>
          <li>Your account needs to have JWTs required on License requests (PAS enabled). Contact your account manager for details.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>To use the <code translate="No">climit</code> and <code translate="No">dlimit</code> claims, you need the following:
        <ul>
          <li>Content needs to be encrypted with DRM</li>
          <li>Your account needs to be enabled for CSL with the Check Rights flag enabled. Contact your account manager for details.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Each token has an expiration, and it needs to be set when it is created. Your integrations are responsible for keeping the renewal process.</li>
      <li>By default, mid-stream checks happen every 5 minutes.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="Key_license_protection">Key/license protection</h2>
    <p>DRM or HLSe content protection uses license/key requests, which can protect every stream request.</p>

    <p>You can use this feature when your content needs to be public but from a trusted request. For example, regional broadcasters with exclusive content encrypted with HLSe want to ensure that only requests from its platform are accessing the content. This means that viewers can only stream content from your platform. They will not be able to stream it outside of the platform, even with the stream URLs.</p>

    <h3>Enabling key/license protections</h3>
    <p>To enable this feature, contact your account manager. They will enable the Playback Authorization Service flag.</p>
    <p>With this feature enabled, every key or license request to decrypt the content needs a valid JWT token (JWT signed with your private key). </p>

    <h3>Notes</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>This feature can be used without using Playback Restrictions.</li>
      <li>The JWT token doesn’t require specific permissions (claims). It just needs to be signed with the customer’s private key.</li>
      <li>Your content needs to be encrypted HLSe or DRM.</li>
    </ul>
