    <p>The basic workflow for using Aspera to transfer your files to Video Cloud is as follows:</p>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist-restart">
      <li>Go to <a href="https://ingest-transfer.brightcove.com/">https://ingest-transfer.brightcove.com/</a> and log in using you Video Cloud credentials with the proper permissions (see <a href="#Credentials">Credentials</a> below).</li>
      <li>Upload the files you want to ingest into Video Cloud.</li>
      <li>Wait for the transfer to finish</li>
      <li>Monitor the rest of the ingestion in Video Cloud using <a href="https://studio.support.brightcove.com/media/index.html">Studio</a> or the <a href="/cms/index.html">CMS API</a>.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>There are two kinds of credentials for using Aspera for ingestion:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Upload</strong> - for simple ingestion of videos without metadata or additional assets. Simply upload the video files. If a manifest of metadata is present, it will be ignored.

        <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information language-editable">Simple upload requires special permissions - submit a <a href="https://supportportal.brightcove.com/">Support Request</a> to obtain these permissions.</aside>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Upload with Metadata</strong> - in this case, file transfer will start when the manifest file providing metadata information is uploaded. This operation can be used to add metadata to a video on upload, to add assets to a video already ingested or to re-transcode a video in Video Cloud. See the <a href="/aspera/manifest-metadata-reference.html">Manifest Reference</a> for details of this XML file. Note that there is a limit of 100 videos per manifest file.

        <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information language-editable">Upload with metadata requires special permissions - submit a <a href="https://supportportal.brightcove.com/">Support Request</a> to obtain these permissions.</aside>
      </li>
    </ul>
