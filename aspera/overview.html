      Note: If an user has access to more than one Video Cloud account and tries to ingest content using Aspera, the content will be ingested to the first Video Cloud account the system finds for that user. To avoid this, the user must have specific credentials for each one of the Video Cloud account to which he/she should be able to upload content using this service. 
      <p>One workaround: You can create a new email alias using a <code translate="No">+</code> character if your email provider supports it (e.g. Gmail) Example:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Normal email address: mary@mycompany.com</li>
        <li>
          Alias email addresses:
          <ul>
            <li>mary+sports_upload@mycompany.com</li>
            <li>mary+news_upload@mycompany.com</li>
            <li>mary+prod_upload@mycompany.com</li>
            <li>mary+dev_upload@mycompany.com</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

    <p>The basic workflow for using Aspera to transfer your files to Video Cloud is as follows:</p>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist-restart">
      <li>Go to <a href="https://ingest-transfer.brightcove.com/">https://ingest-transfer.brightcove.com/</a> and log in using you Video Cloud credentials with the proper permissions (see <a href="#Credentials">Credentials</a> below).</li>
      <li>Upload the files you want to ingest into Video Cloud.</li>
      <li>Wait for the transfer to finish</li>
      <li>Monitor the rest of the ingestion in Video Cloud using <a href="https://studio.support.brightcove.com/media/index.html">Studio</a> or the <a href="/cms/index.html">CMS API</a>.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>There are two kinds of credentials for using Aspera for ingestion:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Upload</strong> - for simple ingestion of videos without metadata or additional assets. Simply upload the video files. If a manifest of metadata is present, it will be ignored.

        <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information language-editable">Simple upload requires special permissions - submit a <a href="https://supportportal.brightcove.com/">Support Request</a> to obtain these permissions.</aside>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Upload with Metadata</strong> - in this case, file transfer will start when the manifest file providing metadata information is uploaded. This operation can be used to add metadata to a video on upload, to add assets to a video already ingested or to re-transcode a video in Video Cloud. See the <a href="/aspera/manifest-metadata-reference.html">Manifest Reference</a> for details of this XML file. Note that there is a limit of 100 videos per manifest file.

        <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information language-editable">Upload with metadata requires special permissions - submit a <a href="https://supportportal.brightcove.com/">Support Request</a> to obtain these permissions.</aside>
