    <p>An <strong>as-run log</strong> provides a record of what content (including ads and bumpers) was actually transmitted by a Cloud Playout Channel during the previous day. As-run logs are useful for auditing purposes and record-keeping.</p>
    <p>As-run logs can be retrieved for your channels using the <a href="/cloud-playout-apis/getting-started/overview-channel-api.html">Channels API</a>.</p>
