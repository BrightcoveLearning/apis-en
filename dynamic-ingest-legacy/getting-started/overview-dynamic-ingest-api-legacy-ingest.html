    <h2 id="API_functionality">API functionality</h2>
    
    <p>Brightcove's Dynamic Ingest (DI) API is based on functionality where video source files are downloaded from the customer's storage location and specified renditions of the source files are created. (There is also an option to <a href="/dynamic-ingest/getting-started/source-file-upload-api-dynamic-ingest.html">upload your source files</a> to a temporary location where Dynamic Ingest can access them.) The platform is cloud-centric, globally-distributed and based on modern practices to deliver best in class consistency and speed.</p>
    
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: for segmented video types (HLS and DASH) some players do not handle the case where the audio and video stream lengths differ by more than a segment's duration. If you encounter this, try using a shorter segment length.</aside>

    <h2 id="workflowoverview">Workflow overview</h2>
    
    <p>A number of systems/technologies are used in the overall transcoding and storage of media. They are:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Content Management System (CMS) API</strong>: Creates a video object for use in the DI API</li>
      <li><strong>Zencoder</strong>: Transcodes the video creating multiple renditions</li>
      <li><strong>Amazon S3</strong>: Moves the master and renditions to storage, based on profile settings</li>
      <li><strong>Catalog</strong>: Stores requisite information associated with the video</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>After initial transcoding, you have the following actions you can perform on the media:</p>
    
    <ul><!-- the following item on hold indefinitely --><!-- <li><strong>Delete</strong>: Delete, when needed, the master or all items</li> -->
      <li><strong>Re-transcode</strong>: Create new renditions when master is present (error if master is not present)</li>
      <li><strong>Replace</strong>: Point to a new master, or replace an existing master</li>
    </ul>
    </section>
    
    <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="operations">Operations</h2>
    
    <p>When you use the DI API you will perform different operations, such as reading an ingest profile and writing ingest information to your account. The following is a complete list of operations required for DI tasks:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>video-cloud/video/create</li>
      <li>video-cloud/video/read</li>
      <!-- for adding images -->
      <li>video-cloud/video/update</li>
      <li>video-cloud/ingest-profiles/profile/read</li>
      <li>video-cloud/ingest-profiles/account/read</li>
      <li>video-cloud/ingest-profiles/account/write</li>
      <li>video-cloud/ingest-profiles/profile/write</li>
      <li>video-cloud/upload-urls/read</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>To obtain client credentials, use the Studio <a href="/general/managing-api-authentication-credentials.html">admin tools</a> or see one of the following documents:</p>
    
    <ul>

    <h2 id="best_practices">Best practices</h2>
    
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--tip">
    <ul>
      <li>A 20 request per second limit on each account for total requests across DI and the CMS API (CMS API or Ingest API requests)</li>
      <li>A limit of 100 concurrent DI jobs per account (there are additional options for large batches of requests for accounts converted to <a href="/dynamic-ingest/getting-started/overview-dynamic-ingest-api-dynamic-delivery.html">Dynamic Delivery</a>)</li>
      <li>Ingest content smaller than 100GBs per file (if you need to ingest larger files please contact your Account Manager)</li>
      <li>If you are ingesting files in batches, limit concurrent normal priority jobs to 100 and wait for one job to complete processing before adding another</li>
      <li>Validate ingest profile changes before ingesting full batches</li>
      <li>You should <strong>not</strong> have duplicate jobs processing for the same asset. An asset in this instance is defined as a video object, an audio track in a specific language, a text track in a specific language, or a specific image type. Here are some examples to illustrate the point:
      <ul>
        <li>UNACCEPTABLE: Submit an ingest request for a video file and then submit another video ingest request with the same Video ID before the first ingest job completes</li>
        <li>ACCEPTABLE: Submit an ingest request for a video file, then submit an ingest request for a text track in English associated with the same Video ID, and then submit an ingest request for a thumbnail image with the same Video ID</li>
        <li>ACCEPTABLE: Submit an ingest job for a text track in English and then submit an ingest request for a text track in Spanish in parallel</li>
        <li>UNACCEPTABLE: Submit a request to ingest a Spanish audio track and then immediately submit a request to ingest another Spanish audio track on the same Video ID</li>
      </ul>
      </li>
      <li>The <code translate="No">profile </code> field for ingest requests is <strong>optional</strong>. Avoid hard-coding the <code translate="No">profile </code> in apps and integrations - instead, set the most commonly used profile as the <strong>default</strong> for the account, and omit the field, or <a href="/ingest-profiles/references/reference.html#api-Profile-Get_All_Ingest_Profiles">fetch the available profiles for the account</a> and force the user to choose one.</li>
    </ul>
    </aside>
    </section>
    
    <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="sourceLocations">Valid source locations</h2>
    
    <p>Dynamic Ingest can pull source video files from: HTTP/HTTPS or S3 - with or without authentication</p>
    
    <p>Examples:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>http://example.com/path/to/input.avi</li>
      <li>https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3641457/Bird_Titmouse.mp4</li>
      <li>s3://my-bucket/video.mp4</li>
    </ul>
    
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Notes:
    <ul>
      <li>Video file names (including the extension) must not exceed 120 single-byte (60 double-byte) characters. If it does, the video will be ingested successfully, but you will not be able to retranscode it later</li>
      <li>Hostnames (for file locations or callback URLs) must not contain underscore characters or certain other punctuation or special characters per IETF specifications. See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostname#Restrictions_on_valid_hostnames">this Wikipedia article</a> for more information. Errors will be returned if hostnames do not conform to the IETF standard.</li>
      <li>Dynamic Ingest can <strong>not</strong> ingest files hosted on Google Drive, because Google Drive does not generate direct links to video files.</li>
    </ul>
    </aside>
    
    <h3>Notes on S3</h3>
    
    <p>If your videos are in a protected S3 bucket, see <a href="/dynamic-ingest/general/using-dynamic-ingest-s3.html">Using Dynamic Ingest with S3</a> for details on how to set up permissions for Dynamic Ingest to access your files.</p>
    
    <p>The advantages of using pull-based ingest include a simpler workflow and having a repository of your own digital masters. If this is not an option for you, however, you can also use <a href="/dynamic-ingest/getting-started/source-file-upload-api-dynamic-ingest.html">Source File Upload</a> to upload your videos and other assets to a temporary location from which Dynamic Ingest can access them.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="Source_file_names">Source file names</h2>
    
    <p>All input urls must properly url encoded according to <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-2.1">RFC 3986</a> when being sent to Brightcove. This means that any <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-2.2">reserved characters</a> found in the path of the url are percent encoded (spaces being encoded to <code translate="No">%20</code>), and any reserved characters found in the query of the url are percent encoded (spaces being encoded to <code translate="No">+</code> or <code translate="No">%20</code>, and <code translate="No">+</code> being encoded to <code translate="No">%2B</code>).</p>

    <h2 id="ingestingVideos">Ingesting videos</h2>
    
    <p>There are two API calls required for ingesting videos:</p>
    
    <ol>
      <li>Call the CMS API to create a video object in the Video Cloud system and get its id</li>
      <li>Call the DI API to provide the URL for the video source file and specify the <a href="/ingest-profiles-legacy/references/standard-ingest-profiles-legacy-transcoding.html">ingest profile</a> to be used</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>A sample set of basic requests would look like the following:</p>
    
    <h3>CMS API request</h3>
    
    <dl>
      <dt>HTTP method</dt>
      <dd>POST</dd>
      <dt>Request URL</dt>

    </code>
    </pre>
      </dd>
    </dl>
    
    <p>The response data will include the video <code translate="No">id </code>, which is used in the next request.</p>

    <h2 id="sampleAssets">Sample assets</h2>
    
    <p>Brightcove Learning Services provides some sample assets you can use to experiment with in getting started with Dynamic Ingest. These assets include short videos, images, and WebVTT captions in multiple languages:</p>
    
    <ul>

    <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="replaceVideo">Replace a video</h2>
    
    <p>To replace a video with a new version or a new set of renditions, the Dynamic Ingest API call is exactly the same as it would be for <a href="/dynamic-ingest-legacy/code-samples/dynamic-ingest-api-sample-ingesting-videos-legacy-ingest.html">ingesting new videos</a> - the only difference is that you do not need to make a prior call to the CMS API to create the video object in the Video Cloud system and get an id for it. If the source video file at the specified URL is the same one originally ingested, you will simply get a new set of renditions. If the source file is new, you will be replacing the existing video. All videos will remain playable with existing renditions until retranscoding is complete.</p>

    <h2 id="retranscode">Retranscode a video</h2>
    
    <p>If you chose to <a href="https://studio.support.brightcove.com/admin/managing-ingest-profiles.html">archive a master</a> when you ingested the video through the Dynamic Ingest API or the Studio Upload Module, then you can also retranscode the video from the master. Again the URL for the ingest request will be the same, but the request body will have the following:</p>

      <li>The recommended standard ingest profiles (videocloud-default-v1, screencast-1280, high-resolution, smart-player-transition, single-bitrate-standard, and single-bitrate-high) will all archive the master. If you are using a custom ingest profile, you must <a href="https://studio.support.brightcove.com/admin/managing-ingest-profiles.html">specify that that the master</a> should be archived if you want to be able to retranscode from the master later.</li>
      <li>The master is <strong>never</strong> modified during retranscoding</li>
      <li>Settings for archiving and distributing masters are <strong>never</strong> modified during retranscoding</li>
      <li>Known Issue: when you retranscode a video using Dynamic Ingestion, the activation date for the video is updated to the current date. If you use Smart Playlists ordered by activation date, this will affect the order of the videos in the playlist.</li>
