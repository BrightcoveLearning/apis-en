    <h2 id="Introduction">Introduction</h2>
    <p>You can use Media RSS (MRSS) to have Brightcove pull your content from your own system from an MRSS feed that you publish. Video Cloud pulls the metadata from the MRSS feed and either creates a remote asset or downloads (from where they are hosted) and processes the videos and any associated assets (thumbnails, closed caption files, etc.).</p>
    <p>You can have up to 5 MRSS feeds configured for a single Video Cloud account.</p>

    <h2 id="About_MRSS">About MRSS</h2>
    <p>Media RSS (MRSS) is an extension of RSS that allows you to syndicate multimedia files in RSS feeds. For technical details, see the <a href="https://www.rssboard.org/media-rss">Media RSS Specification</a>.</p>

    <h2 id="Setting_Up_MRSS">Setting Up MRSS</h2>
    <p>Contact your Account Manager and indicate that you want to use MRSS. Your MRSS feed will need to be hosted on a public URL, and the videos and assets that it contains must also be on public URLs. URLs can include <code translate="No">http://</code> or <code translate="No">https://</code>.</p>

    <h2 id="Using_mrss">Using MRSS</h2>
    <p>To use MRSS, you host metadata and/or videos and other files (thumbnails, closed captions) on a web server, and create an <a href="/mrss-ingestion/getting-started/xml-manifest-for-ingestion-via-mrss.html">XML manifest file</a> that references that content.</p>
    <p>Note that the MRSS feed will be pulled by Brightcove every five minutes.</p>

    <h3>Using MRSS to Pull Metadata Only</h3>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist">
        <li>Create an XML manifest file as described in <a href="/mrss-ingestion/getting-started/xml-manifest-for-ingestion-via-mrss.html">XML manifest file</a>.</li>
        <li>Host the XML manifest file on one of the MRSS locations you provided. <strong><em>Make sure that the filename and path matches exactly one of the paths you provided to Brightcove</em></strong>.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Using MRSS to Pull Videos, Thumbnails, and Closed Caption Files</h3>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist-restart">
      <li>Host one or more files (videos, thumbnails, and closed caption files) on a web server. The URLs must be publicly accessible.</li>
      <li>
        Create an <a href="/mrss-ingestion/getting-started/xml-manifest-for-ingestion-via-mrss.html">XML manifest file</a>. Make sure that the entries in the file reference the files on your server.
      </li>
      <li>
        Host the XML manifest file on one of the MRSS locations you provided. <strong><em>Make sure that the filename and path matches exactly one of the paths you provided to Brightcove</em></strong>.
        <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: Unfortunately, the concept of "client logging" does not apply to MRSS feed-based processing. The best way to verify that your feed is processing successfully is to check for the appearance of your assets, either with <a href="https://studio.support.brightcove.com/media/getting-started-media-module.html">Video Cloud Studio</a> or the Video Cloud <a href="/cms/getting-started/overview-cms-api.html">CMS API</a>.</aside>

    <p>If you are migrating videos to Video Cloud from another platform, or just have a large number of videos you need to ingest, let us help you make the process smooth by following these guidelines:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://supportportal.brightcove.com/">Open a Support ticket</a> <strong>at least 3 days in advance</strong> indicating that you are planning to start ingesting a large amount of assets.</li>
      <li>Provide a timeline of when you expect to start and finish.</li>
      <li>Indicate which ingestion method are you planning to use: API, MRSS, Aspera (with our without XML manifest).</li>
      <li>Indicate the total number of videos you will ingest.</li>
      <li>Indicate the average video file size.</li>
      <li>Indicate the average video duration (minutes).</li>
      <li>Indicate the egion where you content is located.</li>
    </ul>
