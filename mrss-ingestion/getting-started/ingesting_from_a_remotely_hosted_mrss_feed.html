    <h2 id="Introduction">Introduction</h2>
    <p>You can use Media RSS (MRSS) to have Brightcove pull your content from your own system from an MRSS feed that you publish. Video Cloud pulls the metadata from the MRSS feed and either creates a remote asset or downloads (from where they are hosted) and processes the videos and any associated assets (thumbnails, closed caption files, etc.).</p>

    <h2 id="About_MRSS">About MRSS</h2>
    <p>Media RSS (MRSS) is an extension of RSS that allows you to syndicate multimedia files in RSS feeds. For technical details, see the <a href="https://www.rssboard.org/media-rss">Media RSS Specification</a>.</p>

    <h2 id="Setting_Up_MRSS">Setting Up MRSS</h2>
    <p>Contact your Account Manager and indicate that you want to use MRSS. Your MRSS feed will need to be hosted on a public URL, and the videos and assets that it contains must also be on public URLs. URLs can include http:// or https://.</p>

  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="Using_mrss">Using MRSS</h2>
    <p>To use MRSS, you host metadata and/or videos and other files (thumbnails, closed captions) on a web server, and create an <a href="/mrss-ingestion/getting-started/xml-manifest-for-ingestion-via-mrss.html">XML manifest file</a> that references that content.</p>
    <p>Note that the MRSS feed will be pulled by Brightcove every five minutes.</p>

    <h3>Using MRSS to Pull Metadata Only</h3>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist">
        <li>Create an XML manifest file as described in <a href="/mrss-ingestion/getting-started/xml-manifest-for-ingestion-via-mrss.html">XML manifest file</a>. You must use the <code translate="No">ooyala:remoteasset</code> tag for metadata-only ingestion.</li>
        <li>Host the XML manifest file on one of the MRSS locations you provided. <strong><em>Make sure that the filename and path matches exactly one of the paths you provided to Brightcove</em></strong>.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Using MRSS to Pull Videos, Thumbnails, and Closed Caption Files</h3>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist-restart">
      <li>Host one or more files (videos, thumbnails, and closed caption files) on a web server. The URLs must be publicly accessible.</li>
      <li>
        Create an <a href="/mrss-ingestion/getting-started/xml-manifest-for-ingestion-via-mrss.html">XML manifest file</a>. Make sure that the entries in the file reference the files on your server. In particular, the value of the <code translate="No">&lt;media:content&gt;</code> element's <code translate="No">href</code> attribute <strong><em>must</em></strong> be an HTTP URL to the file on your server, as in the following example:
        <pre><code class="language-xml" translate="No">&lt;media:content url="http://mysite.com/upload/lacrosse_70.mov" /&gt;</code></pre>
      </li>
      <li>
        Host the XML manifest file on one of the MRSS locations you provided. <strong><em>Make sure that the filename and path matches exactly one of the paths you provided to Brightcove</em></strong>.
        <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: Unfortunately, the concept of "client logging" does not apply to MRSS feed-based processing. The best way to verify that your feed is processing successfully is to check for the appearance of your assets, either with <a href="https://studio.support.brightcove.com/media/getting-started-media-module.html">Video Cloud Studio</a> or the Video Cloud <a href="/cms/getting-started/overview-cms-api.html">CMS API</a>.</aside>
