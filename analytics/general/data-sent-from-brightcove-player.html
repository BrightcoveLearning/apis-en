    The content of this page has been removed because:
    <ul>
      <li>It is confusing, as the data sent by the player does not generally correspond to the metrics returned by the Brightcove Analytics system (most of these metrics are calculated based on multiple pieces of data sent by the player, as well as data obtained from other systems, such as CDNs).</li>
      <li>It is redundant, as the documentation on <a href="/data-collection/index.html">Data Collection API</a> also contains this information.</li>
      <li>If you really wish to see exactly what the player is sending, you can do so by opening a page with a Brightcove player in your browser, open the Developer Tools for the browser, and looking in the Network tab for requests sent to <code translate="No">http://metrics.brightcove.com/v2/tracker</code> - the URL parameters on the requests will contain all the data being sent to the data collector.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="Introduction">Introduction</h2>
    <p>This topic details the information fields that are sent by the Brightcove Player to the <a href="/data-collection/index.html">data collector</a> for use by the Analytics system. Note that the players sends multiple batches of data to the collector, and each batch is associated with an <a href="#events">event</a>. Not all data fields are sent in every batch, some may not be sent at all if tha associated data is not available for some reason.</p>
    <p>Also note that the player can be configured to send additional information - see <a href="/data-collection/getting-started/overview-data-collection-api-v2.html">Overview: The Data Collection API</a> for more details. This topic covers the data that is sent by default.</p>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information language-editable">Also note that there is not a 1:1 correspondence between the data fields list here and the field available in Analytics, because our Analytics data includes calculated fields and also retrieves information from other sources, such as CDNs, in addition to what is sent by the player.</aside>
