    <h2 id="logic">App Logic</h2>

    <p>This is a hybrid app that uses the <span translate="No">CMS API</span> to retrieve playlist information, and then the <span translate="No">Analytics API</span> to retrieve analytics for the videos in the playlist. There is a slight twist: for EXPLICIT (manual) playlist, the metadata includes the video ids, so we can take those directly to the Analytics API; for smart playlists, however, we need to go back to <span translate="No">CMS API</span> using the search, sort, and limit criteria for the playlist to get the video information, which we can then take to the Analytics API:</p>

      <p>To get a <code translate="No">client_id</code> and <code translate="No">client_secret</code>, you will need to go to the OAuth UI and register this app:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><a href="/general/managing-api-authentication-credentials.html">Managing API Authentication Credentials</a></li>
      </ul>

      <p>These are the permissions you will need:</p>

        <figcaption class="bcls-caption--image">Analytics API Permissions</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>You can also get your credentials via CURL or Postman - see:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><a href="/oauth/guides/oauth-create-client-credentials-using-curl.html">Get Client Credentials Using CURL</a></li>
        <li><a href="/oauth/guides/oauth-create-client-credentials-using-postman.html">Get Client Credentials Using Postman</a></li>
      </ul>

      <p>If you are getting credentials directly from the API, these are the permissions you need:</p>

      <pre class="line-numbers">
      <code class="language-json" translate="No">[
        "video-cloud/analytics/read",

      </summary>

      <p>In order to build your own version the sample app on this page, you must create and host your own proxy. (The proxies used by Brightcove Learning Services only accept requests from Brightcove domains.) A sample proxy, very similar to the one we use, but without the checks that block requests from non-Brightcove domains, can be found in <a href="https://github.com/BrightcoveLearning/sample-proxy-apps">this GitHub repository</a>. You will also find basic instructions for using it there, and a more elaborate guide to building apps around the proxy in <a href="/getting-started/learning-guide-using-rest-apis.html">Using the REST APIs</a>.</p>
