Questions about Captions

I think embed_closed_caption is false by default (true?)

Can it be used in an auto captions request (Dynamic Ingest - https://apis.support.brightcove.com/dynamic-ingest/ingest-guides/requesting-auto-captions.html#Audio_track_metadata)?

I don't see an option in the UI to embed closed captions - does that mean this can only be done via the Dynamic Ingest API?
