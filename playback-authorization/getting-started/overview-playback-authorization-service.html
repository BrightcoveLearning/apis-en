<h2 id="Introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Brightcove's Playback Authorization Service (PAS) offers an extra level of security when delivering DRM-protected content with Dynamic Delivery. This is particularly useful for customers who want to control access to their content, and prevent unauthorized sharing of content.</p>

<p>PAS allows customers to create, delete, and blacklist access tokens with a series of configuration variables based on their own business logic, such as viewer permissions. This prevents license information from being shared with 3rd parties.</p>

<p>This feature is available for Subscription Video-On-Demand (SVOD) customers who are willing to implement a middleware solution between their User Management System (UMS) and Brightcove's playback service.</p>

<h2 id="Implementation">Implementation</h2>

<p>Brightcove's Playback Authorization Service is a regionally deployed service. Customers will have to manage viewer access permissions through an external User Management System (UMS) and integrated with PAS through a middleware application.</p>

<p>
  PAS provides two use cases for customers:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Securing DRM License Requests</strong> <br>Using tokens with DRM-protected content, PAS will authorize requests based on user or session information to allow or deny access to the DRM licenses.<br><br>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Securing Encryption Keys</strong> <br>Using tokens with HLSe content, PAS will authorize requests based on user or session information to allow or deny access to the encryption keys and improve security on standard encryption.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>PAS is not an out-of-the-box solution. It requires the customer to implement a middleware solution between a User Management System (UMS) and Brightcove's Playback Authorization Service. This integration can be done with the Brightcove Global Services (BGS) team or DIY by the customer. </p>

<p>
  PAS supports the ability to pass a signed set of content protection options and grant a DRM license or Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) key if these protection options are valid.
</p>

<p>
  Publishers create a <a href="https://general.support.brightcove.com/developer/create-jwt.html">JSON Web Token (JWT)</a>. This token is passed with the playback request. If the token is invalid or expired, access to the content will be restricted.
</p>
<p>
  The token expiration must be specified, and it cannot have a value greater than 30 days.
