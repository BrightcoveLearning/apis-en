  <p>The Brightcove Syndication Feed API is a public API for retrieving MRSS feeds created using the <a href="/social-syndication/getting-started/public-syndication-api-overview.html">Syndication Configuration API</a>.</p>
  <p>The Syndication Configuration API can also be used to retrieve feeds by simply opening the <code>syndication_url</code> returned in the syndication object into a browser, but the Feed API is different in that it requires no authentication - anyone having the right URL can retrieve the feed.</p>
  <p>The primary use cases for retrieving feeds using one API or the other are as follows:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>If you only want to host the feed yourself, for subscribers, for example, then you would use the Syndication Configuration API to retrieve the feed.</li>
    <li>If you have syndication partners who you wish to give the feed to use and host in whatever way they wish, you can give the Feed API URL with the <code>syndication_id</code> to retrieve feeds directly.</li>
  </ul>
