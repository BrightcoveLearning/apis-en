      <dl>
        <dt>Requesting video or player fields in the <code>fields</code> without requesting them as dimensions</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>If you use <code>video </code> or <code>player </code> fields (such a <code>video </code>, <code>video_name </code>, <code>player </code> or <code>player_name </code>) in the fields to return but do not include them in the dimensions in the <code>dimensions </code>, the response items will include irrelevant values for those items and should be ignored. Other values in the items will be valid</p>

          <p><strong>Workaround</strong>: Do not include video or player fields in the response fields unless you also include them as <code>dimensions </code>.</p>        
        </dd>
        <dt>High number of "other" results for <code>device_manufacturer</code></dt>
        <dd>In some cases, you may see a high number of "other" results for the <code>device_manufacturer</code> field. This occurs when the Data Collector does not recognize the <code>user_agent</code> delivered to it with analytics data. The most common cause that we have identified for this is a custom user_agent string created by Instagram, but there are probably others.</dd>

    <h2 id="CMS_API">CMS API</h2>
        <dl>
          <dt>In certain cases, the <code class="”notranslate”">original_filename </code> gets corrupted</dt>
          <dd>In some cases, the <code class="”notranslate”">original_filename </code> field for videos gets corrupted and will not contain the real filename.</dd>
          <dt>Tags may not contain commas</dt>
          <dd>If you attempt to add a tag to a video that contains a comma (e.g. "SomeCo, Inc") the request will fail with an "illegal tag" error</dd>
        <dt>Scheduled Videos</dt>
        <dd>Because the Playback API and Catalog cache videos for up to 10-15 minutes, a player requesting a video scheduled to become available during the next few minutes (up to 20), may not be able to get a playable video until the cache refreshes.</dd>
        <dt><code>has_digital_master</code></dt>
        <dd>
          <p>If you are using this field to test whether a video can be retranscoded, it is not reliable for shared videos, as it will be true if the original video has a master, but still cannot be retranscoded by the affiliate account.</p>

          <p><strong>Workaround</strong>: If videos are shared to the account, you need to test for both <code class="”notranslate”">has_digital_master = true </code> and <code class="”notranslate”">sharing.by_external_account = false </code>. Sample code (JavaScript):</p>

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-javascript">var video={some_video_object}
if (video.sharing !== null) {
  if (video.sharing.by_external_account === false) {
    if (video.has_digital_master) {
    // video can be retranscoded
    }
  }
}</code></pre>

        <dt>Duplicate Reference ID allowed for playlists when using update/PATCH</dt>
        <dd>When you update a playlist <code>reference_id</code> using the CMS API (or the Media module, since it uses the same API request), a reference id already in use for another playlist will be allowed.</dd>
