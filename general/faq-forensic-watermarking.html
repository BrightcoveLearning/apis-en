      <details>
          <summary>How does content detection work?</summary>
          <p>The detection process is based on a portion of the content that is able to be downloaded, captured, or recorded into a file. A specific tool from NAGRA, called <strong>Packager</strong>, generates a <strong>.pak</strong> file. This file is submitted to NAGRA to retrieve the unique sequence delivered, which is then matched to a user. You are responsible for matching the sequence to the user. Detection services are acquired directly with NAGRA; usually done by a 3rd party hired by the content owner to crawl the internet to find illegal content.</p>

        <summary>How does NAGRA track the number of transactions used by a customer?</summary>
        <p>NAGRA does not have a way to track if any portion of our software is connected to NAGRA for reporting transactions.</p>
        <p>You are responsible for downloading from the Analytics API a report with the number of unique viewers per day, every 24hrs, to provide as proof the number of transactions used.</p>
