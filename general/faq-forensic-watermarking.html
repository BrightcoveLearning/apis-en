          <summary>How is the NAGRA License key obtained?</summary>
          <p>Review the <a href="https://dtv.nagra.com/nexguard-forensic-watermarking">NAGRA</a> website. Once you have a contract with NAGRA, then they will send you a license key.</p>

        <summary>How does content detection work?</summary>
        <p>The detection process is based on a portion of the content that is able to be downloaded, captured, or recorded into a file. A specific tool from NAGRA, called <strong>Packager</strong>, generates a <strong>.pak</strong> file. This file is submitted to NAGRA to retrieve the unique sequence delivered, which is then matched to a user. You are responsible for matching the sequence to the user. Detection services are acquired directly with NAGRA; usually done by a 3rd party hired by the content owner to crawl the internet to find illegal content.</p>
