    <p>Late binding is the process of associating progressive MP4 renditions with a video after it has been ingested, Late binding allows you to add or modify MP4 renditions to a video without having to entirely retranscode the video.</p>
    <h3 id="mp4">Do I need MP4 renditions?</h3>
    <p>There are several reasons why you might want to have MP4 renditions in addition to HLS and/or DASH renditions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Sharing using the Social module</strong> - The Social module  requires that an MP4 rendition be available to share to social media. An MP4 rendition is also required to download a video using the Social module.</li>
      <li><strong>Downloading videos</strong> - If you wish to give viewers the ability to download a copy of the video, it must have MP4 renditions.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Closed captions</strong> - legal accessibility standards are most strict (currently) in the EU, but requirements vary and change. The most strict standards require embedded 608 close captions.
        <p>If 608 captions are embedded in the source video, they will be passed through to all renditions and therefore be present in HLS and DASH as well as MP4. Brightcove can add 608 close captions to MP4 renditions only.</p>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Cloud Playout</strong> - In order to be <a href="{{ site.cloud_playout_path }}managing-content/cloud-playout-add-content.html">added to  Cloud Playout channels</a>, videos must have at least one MP4 rendition.</li>
      <li><strong>Streaming to Legacy Devices</strong> - Older devices such as Android 4.x and prior require MP4 renditions for streaming via progressive download.</li>
    </ul>
