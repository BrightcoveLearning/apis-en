title: 'Ingesting WebVTT Files'
description: 'Dynamic Ingest can be used to ingest WebVTT files (for captions, subtitles, chapters, etc.) with your video, or separately, after the video has been ingested. For Dynamic Delivery videos, you can also ingest SRT, DFXP, or SCC captions. This topic explains the details of adding text tracks files to your videos using the Dynamic Ingest API.'

    <h2 id="Adding_closed_captions_to_MP4_renditions">Adding closed captions to MP4 renditions</h2>
    <p>In addition to adding text tracks to your HLS and/or DASH renditions, you can add <a href="https://shop.cta.tech/products/line-21-data-services">608 closed captions</a> to progressive MP4 renditions by including the <code translate="No">"embed_closed_caption": true</code> flag in your WebVTT ingest request.</p>

    <p>To embed closed captions for a video you are ingesting, be sure to use an ingest profile that includes one or more MP4 renditions. If you are adding text tracks/closed captions to an existing video, be sure it has at least one MP4 rendition, or re-transcode with an ingest profile that will include MP4.</p>

    <p>If you are using Cloud Playout, note that you can now <a href="https://studio.support.brightcove.com/cloud-playout/import-captions.html">import these closed captions</a> into your channel to provide them to your viewers.</p>

    <h3>Notes</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The languages currently supported for 608 embedded captions are: English, Spanish, French, Portuguese, Italian, German, and Dutch.</li>
      <li>For embedded 608 captions <strong>only</strong>, only European (Latin) characters are supported. Double-byte languages such as Chinese and Japanese are not supported.</li>
      <li>If the source file already contains 608 closed captions, those will <strong>not</strong> be retained in any MP4 renditions.instead new closed captions will be embedded using the contents of the ingested captions</code>.</li>
      <li>Closed captions currently <strong>cannot</strong> be added while you are retranscoding video - you must be ingesting or replacing the video. Retranscode jobs will support this feature in a future release.</li>
      <li>This feature <strong>cannot</strong> be used when you are <a href="/dynamic-ingest/ingest-guides/requesting-auto-captions.html">requesting auto captions</a>.</li>
      <li>If your account is enabled for Cloud Playout, you can verify that the closed captions were added by including the video in a channel (Cloud Playout channels always use MP4 renditions).</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- <h3>Verifying that closed captions were added</h3>
    <p>Currently there is no API flag to indicate that closed captions were added to MP4 renditions. To verify that they are there, you can use the sample app below to test. </p>

    <p>Notes:</p>
    
    <ol>
      <li>Caption file names should only include letters (upper or lower case), numbers, dashes (-) and underscores (_).</li>
      <li>The <code translate="No">label</code> for the captions is used by the Brightcove player for the captions language menu. Best practice is to use the appropriate language for the label. For example: <code translate="No">français</code> for <code translate="No">French</code> and so forth.</li>
      <li>The text of the captions must be encoded UTF-8 to display properly for double-byte languages such as Japanese and Korean.</li>
      <li>The default value is not per track, but set to true for all tracks of the same language (<code translate="No">srclang</code>).</li>
      <li>For images and text tracks, only public HTTP or HTTPS URLs or signed URLs for AWS S3 or Google Cloud Storage are supported.</li>
      <li>for text tracks, Dynamic Ingest adds/appends them to the video’s vtt list even if it is a re-encode request. You should use the <a href="/cms/managing-videos/using-cms-api-add-webvtt-captions-text-tracks.html">CMS API</a> to manage them (update/delete).</li>
      <li>Dynamic Ingest accepts up to 100 text tracks at a time.</li>
      <li>Although <code translate="No">"mime_type": "text/vtt"</code> is generally supported for WebVTT, Dynamic Ingest does <strong>not</strong> currently allow that field for ingestion of text tracks.</li>
      <!-- <li>Existing text tracks have <code translate="no">“status”: null</code>, which won’t hide text tracks in players.</li> -->
