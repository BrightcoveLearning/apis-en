    <h2>Overview</h2>
    
    <p>Files associated with the Delivery System are managed through REST APIs, and optionally through Git. These files are delivered to <strong>players.brightcove.net</strong> either through an API call or a "git push".</p>
    
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">The Delivery System API is not needed for most creation and publishing of Brightcove Players. This API is recommended for advanced developers only.</aside>
    
    <p>If you haven't gone through the <a href="/delivery-system/step-step-delivery-system-api.html">Step-by-Step: Delivery System API</a>, it's highly suggested you start there. You'll get security set up, learn some of the basics of the system, and then be ready to dive in further here.</p>

      When you use the Delivery System API to add files to a repository, you should create a new repository for them. Do not use an existing Player Repository. The Player Management API fully manages the contents of player repositories. Any files added to a player repository will be deleted whenever players are republished, or internal upgrades are made, which can happen at any time.

    <h2>Delivery System REST APIs</h2>
    
    <p>The delivery system APIs are centered around repositories, otherwise known as repos. You can manage repos through a group of REST APIs that allow you to add, get, and list your repos. You can also use REST API calls to manipulate files in repos.</p>
    
    <p>You can use the command-line tool curl to use the REST APIs. The REST APIs return responses in JSON format containing the following information on success:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>name: The repo name. This is the same as the name found in the REST API URLs.</li>
      <li>public_url: The base URL where the repo files can be seen.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>The <a href="/delivery-system/step-step-delivery-system-api.html">Step-by-Step: Delivery System</a> provides a hands-on guide to using the Delivery System APIs.</p>

    <section class="bcls-section" id="authentication">
    <h2>Authentication</h2>
    
    <p>You can authorize yourself using either <a href="/oauth/guides/getting-access-tokens.html">OAuth access tokens</a> or through Basic Authentication using your Brightcove username and password. The standard OAuth access tokens should be used for any programmatic usage of the APIs, but the Basic Authentication route is a lot easier for command-line usage and getting started.</p>
    
    <p>We'll use Basic Authentication in the <a href="/delivery-system/step-step-delivery-system-api.html">Step-by-Step</a> examples. If you wanted to use access tokens instead, change:</p>
    
    <pre class="line-numbers">
    <code class="language-bash" translate="No">--user $EMAIL</code></pre>
    
    <p>to:</p>
    
    <pre class="line-numbers">
    <code class="language-bash" translate="No">--header "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN"</code></pre>
    </section>
    
    <section class="bcls-section" id="APIerrors">
    <h2>API Error responses</h2>
    
    <p>There are a number of possible error responses that can returned in JSON format when there's an issue with a REST API call:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>If you try to call an API which does not exist, including misspelling existing API calls, you will get a status code of 404 and a helpful message about what you may have done wrong.</li>
      <li>If your call can not be authenticated or authorized, you will get a 403 status code. Try going over the OAuth guide again to ensure you have a valid access token.</li>
      <li>If you try to use a method other than GET or PUT, the response will contain a 405 status code.</li>
      <li>If there's a problem with processing your request, you'll get a 500 status code and a standard Brightcove error response.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>The standard Brightcove error response mentioned above is a JSON response containing error_code and message properties. The error code will be one of the following:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li><code translate="No">INVALID_LOGIN_CREDENTIALS</code>: the username and password given when using Basic Authentication were not valid</li>
      <li><code translate="No">ACCESS_TOKEN_ERROR</code>: the access token given was not valid</li>
      <li><code translate="No">INVALID_API_CALL</code>: the API call was not formatted properly</li>
      <li><code translate="No">NOT_FOUND</code>: the API call was not pointing to a known resource or was not formatted properly</li>
      <li><code translate="No">NO_PUT_CONTENTS</code>: A multi-part form with a contents key must be used to PUT a repo file</li>
      <li><code translate="No">CREATE_REPO_ERROR</code>: an error occurred while creating a repo</li>
      <li><code translate="No">GET_REPO_ERROR</code>: an error occurred while getting a repo</li>
      <li><code translate="No">GET_REPOS_ERROR</code>: an error occurred while getting all repos</li>
      <li><code translate="No">UNCAUGHT_ERROR</code>: an uncaught error caused things to fail</li>
      <li><code translate="No">UNKNOWN_ERROR</code>: an error which doesn't have an associated error code has happened</li>
    </ul>
