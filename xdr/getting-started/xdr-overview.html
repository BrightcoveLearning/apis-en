    <p>
      Brightcove's Cross-Device Resume (XDR) feature allows viewers to start watching video on one device, pause the video, and then continue watching later on another device. When viewers resume playback, they'll continue watching where they left off. This provides a seamless viewing experience for a piece of content.
    </p>
    <p>
      The XDR service stores viewing activity, including the most recent play position. This information is retrieved to resume playback on any device.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brightcove's XDR feature:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Integrates with your customer web site and mobile device apps
      </li>
      <li>
        Uses REST-based APIs and native language calls on desktop and mobile devices
      </li>
      <li>
        Works with content stored in your Video Cloud library
      </li>
      <li>
        Retains play position information for 90 days
      </li>
      <li>
        Meets GDPR and COPPA compliance
      </li>
    </ul>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note that there is a delay between the submission of XDR data and the availability of that data via the API of up to 30 seconds.</aside>

    <p>This feature allows viewers to start watching on one device, pause it, and continue watching on another device.</p>
    <h3>Step 1</h3>
    <p>As a viewer watches a video, the player continuously records the playhead position of the video being watched. This information is stored in the XDR API.</p>
    <figure class="bcls-figure">
      <img
        class="bcls-image--no-border"
        src="/assets/images/xdr/process-flow1.png"
        alt="Record playhead position"
      />
      <figcaption class="bcls-caption--image">Record playhead position</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <h3>Step 2</h3>
    <p>When the viewer resumes watching the video on a different device, the playhead position is retrieved from the XDR API. Playback resumes where the viewer left off.</p>
    <figure class="bcls-figure">
      <img
        class="bcls-image--no-border"
        src="/assets/images/xdr/process-flow2.png"
        alt="Resume playback"
      />
      <figcaption class="bcls-caption--image">Resume playback</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <h3>Implementation</h3>
    <p>
      To implement Cross-Device Resume, follow these steps:
    </p>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist">
      <li>
        <p>
          Even though viewer data is sent to Brightcove analytics automatically, you need to set the viewer identifier in your app. For details, see the linked documents in step 3.
        </p>
        <p>
          The information sent and stored in the XDR API will include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <code translate="No">account_id</code> - Video Cloud account ID
          </li>
          <li>
            <code translate="No">viewer_id</code> - ID of the viewer whose playheads are being saved
          </li>
          <li>
            <code translate="No">video_id</code> - Video Cloud ID of the video(s) watched by the viewer
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <code translate="No">playhead_seconds</code> - Current playhead position in seconds
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Get a viewer's playback position by making a request to the XDR API. You will need a server-side application to make the REST API request for the playback position.
        </p>
        <p>
          The request to the XDR API returns the playback position in seconds.
        </p>
        <p>
