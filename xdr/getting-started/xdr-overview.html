    <p>
      Brightcove's cross-device resume (XDR) feature lets you start watching video on one device, like mobile, and switch to another device, like your home TV. When you switch, you'll continue watching where you left off. This provides a seamless viewing experience for a piece of content.
    </p>
    <p>
      The XDR service stores user viewing activity, including the most recent play position. This information is used to resume playback on any device.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brightcove's XDR feature:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <!-- <li>
    Allows viewers to start watching on one device and continue watching on another device where they left off
  </li> -->
      <li>
        Integrates with your customer web site and mobile device apps
      </li>
      <li>
        Uses REST-based APIs and native language calls on desktop and mobile devices
      </li>
      <li>
        Works with content stored in your Video Cloud library
      </li>
      <li>
        Retains play position information for 90 days
      </li>
      <li>

      To implement cross-device resume, follow these steps:
    </p>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist">
      <li>
        <p>
          Even though viewer data is sent to Brightcove analytics automatically, you need to set the user identifier.
        </p>
        <p>
          The information sent and stored in the XDR API will include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            userID: end-viewer id
          </li>
          <li>
            assetID: video id
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              playhead: position in seconds
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          For details about setting the user, see the linked documents in step 3.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Get a viewer's playback position by making a request to the XDR API. You will need a server-side application to make the REST API request for the playback position.
        </p>
        <p>
          The request to the XDR API return the playback position in seconds based on:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            accountID: Video Cloud Account id
          </li>
          <li>
            userID: end-viewer id
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              assetID: video id
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
