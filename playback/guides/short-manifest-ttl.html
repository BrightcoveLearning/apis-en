    <h2 id="Introduction">Introduction</h2>

    <p>In the media playback workflow, the player calls the Playback API (or Edge Auth API) to retrieve available manifests to start playback. The player provides a Policy Key or Jason Web Token (JWT) for authentication. For increased availability and scalability, these APIs have a caching layer that stores the responses from the signed manifest URL.</p>
    <p>Since signed manifests are cached, the time to live (TTL) needs to be long enough to be valid for the time it will be in the cache, plus a buffer to be usable by the player. Using short manifest TTLs with long media TTLs provides a solution that prevents easy URL sharing while allowing viewers to continue unimpeded playback.</p>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Sort manifest TTL is only supported with video-on-demand (VOD) content, but can be used with DASH or HLS manifests.</aside>
