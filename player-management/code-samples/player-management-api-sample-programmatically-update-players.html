    <p>In this sample there is nothing to interact with. Using the Player Management API the provided code updates a filtered set of players using an HTTP <code translate="No">PATCH</code> method, then automatically publishes the updated players.</p>
    
    <p>As with all API samples, it is strongly recommended you first study the <a href="/getting-started/learning-guide-using-rest-apis.html">Learning Guide: Using the REST APIs</a> to provide a basis on which to build more REST API knowledge.</p>
    
    <p>The CodePen is supplied as way to view the code discussed later in the document.</p>

    <h2 id="Application_flow">Application flow</h2>
    
    <p>The basic logic behind this application is:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Retrieve all players from a specified account, then filter the set of players to those you wish to update.</li>
      <li>Build an array with the IDs of the filtered set of players.</li>
      <li>Define the updates desired on the filtered set of players, the request that each player be updated accordingly.</li>
      <li>Publish each of the updated players.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">The <code translate="No">makeRequest</code> function is standard code that rarely needs to be modified for use in the process of using the Brightcove REST APIs. For this reason it is not discussed in this document, but is thoroughly detailed in the <a href="/getting-started/learning-guide-using-rest-apis.html">Learning Guide: Using the REST APIs</a> document.</aside>
    <!-- UPDATE task 1 -->
    
    <h3>Retrieve a filtered set of players, and build an array of their IDs</h3>
    
    <p>Find the code which is labeled:</p>
    
    <pre>
    <code class="language-javascript" translate="No">// +++ Configure the request to get players and extract their IDs +++</code></pre>
    
    <p>After defining the options to pass to the proxy to get all players from a specified account, JavaScript's array <code translate="No">filter</code> function is used with the custom <code translate="No">filter_players</code> function to filter the player set. You then loop over the filtered set and push their IDs into another array. Finally you call the function that requests that updates be made.</p>
    <!-- UPDATE task 2 -->
    
    <h3>Request the updates be performed on the filtered set of players</h3>
    
    <p>Find the code which is labeled:</p>
    
    <pre>
    <code class="language-javascript" translate="No">// +++ Configure the request to update filtered players +++</code></pre>
    
    <p>In the <code translate="No">options</code> object you define the options needed to pass to the proxy. Note that this includes the <code translate="No">requestBody</code>, which defines the actual changes you wish to make on the filtered set of players. You must loop over each of the player IDs in the <code translate="No">playerIDsAra</code> and make the request. Note that the function is called recursively. Finally you call the function that requests the players be published.</p>
    <!-- UPDATE task 3 -->
    
    <h3>Request the updated players be published</h3>
    
    <p>Find the code which is labeled:</p>
    
    <pre>
    <code class="language-javascript" translate="No"> // +++ Configure the request to publish updated players +++</code></pre>
    
    <p>Here again you loop over the <code translate="No">playerIDsAra</code> array and make requests that the player be published. If not at the end of the array, the function is called recursively.</p>
