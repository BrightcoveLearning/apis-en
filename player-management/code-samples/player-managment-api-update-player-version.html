    <p>
      This sample uses the Player Management API to update your players' version. Players with version 5 cannot be edited using Video Cloud Studio.
    </p>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">This sample and associated code is provided as a guide for your production development. The code is not certified for production use nor officially supported.</aside>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">This sample helps upgrade the player version to v7.22.2.</aside>
    <!-- <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--warning language-editable">Please note that version 5 players will not be displayed in the new Marketing Studio UI but will still be visible in the standard Video Cloud Studio UI. If you want to know if your account still has V5 players, you can also use the <a href="https://apis.support.brightcove.com/player-management/code-samples/player-management-api-sample-display-players.html">Display Players</a> sample app. </aside> -->

    <h2 id="disclaimer">Disclaimer</h2>

    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">This sample app is meant as a way for you to explore the basics of the Player Management API. It is not meant to be an enterprise ready, deployable app. For instance, form validation is not exhaustive and passwords are sent NOT using HTTPS.
      <p>To learn about the general approach concerning the architecture of this sample app, specifically authentication and AJAX implementations, see the <a href="/getting-started/learning-guide-using-rest-apis.html">examples that use HTTPRequest</a>.</p>

    <h2 id="architecture">App architecture</h2>

    <p>The high-level application logic for this app is as follows:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Gather user data necessary to update the player version</li>
      <li>Build the JSON data structure to pass to the API for updating the player version</li>
      <li>On button click, perform AJAX call to update the player version</li>
      <li>On AJAX call success perform the following:
        <ul>
          <li>Inject JSON response data into HTML page</li>
          <li>Call function to publish player</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Perform AJAX call to publish player</li>
      <li>On AJAX call success perform the following:
        <ul>
          <li>Inject JSON response data into HTML</li>
          <li>Dynamically build HTML that displays selected player information and inject that into HTML page</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>

        <p>To keep the player version up-to-date every time Brightcove promotes a player version, go to the <strong>Player Information</strong> section in Video Cloud Studio and select <strong>Update Mode</strong> in the <strong>automatic</strong> option. This will make the <strong>Player Version</strong> section select the <strong>always latest release</strong> option.</p>

      </summary>

      <p>In order to build your own version the sample app on this page, you must create and host your own proxy. (The proxies used by Brightcove Learning Services only accept requests from Brightcove domains.) A sample proxy, very similar to the one we use, but without the checks that block requests from non-Brightcove domains, can be found in <a href="https://github.com/BrightcoveLearning/sample-proxy-apps">this GitHub repository</a>. You will also find basic instructions for using it there, and a more elaborate guide to building apps around the proxy in <a href="/getting-started/learning-guide-using-rest-apis.html">Using the REST APIs</a>.</p>
