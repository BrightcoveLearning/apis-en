    <h2 id="whatisembed">Why use the embed APIs?</h2>
    
    <p>The embed APIs allow you to create multiple instances of a particular player. A good way to think of this player/instance relationship is as a parent/child relationship. The single player is the parent, and players created with the embed APIs are children of the parent player. The parent player has the bulk of the properties you wish your player to have, and then you can use the embed APIs to customize subsets of properties on different child players. For example, you can load different media or use different plugins and styling with different child players.</p>
    
    <p>The following diagrams help clarify the functionality. Below the parent is shown on the left, and two child players on the right. Observe that:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>The poster is inherited by both children</li>
      <li>The shape of the play button is inherited by the top child, while it is overridden in the bottom child</li>
      <li>The top child adds a property, in this case an overlay, which the parent does not have</li>
    </ul>
    
    <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image" alt="Child Adds Property" src="//learning-services-media.brightcove.com/doc-assets/video-cloud-apis/player-management-api/guides/embeds/embeds-api-guide-parent-child-1.png" />
    <figcaption class="bcls-caption--image">Child Adds Property</figcaption>
    </figure>
    
    <p>Another powerful feature of this parent/child relationship is that the inheritance is ongoing. The following diagram shows a new poster assigned to the parent, and both children will inherit that configuration change.</p>
    
    <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image" alt="Children Inherit Changes" src="//learning-services-media.brightcove.com/doc-assets/video-cloud-apis/player-management-api/guides/embeds/embeds-api-guide-parent-child-2.png" />

    <section id="When_not_to_use" class="bcls-section">
    <h2>When NOT to use the embed APIs</h2>
    
    <p>While there are some good reasons to use the embed APIs if your use case needs it, there's also some good reasons to stick with regular players. Here are a few:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Child players can not be edited using Video Cloud Studio. You can only edit child players through the Player Management API. You can edit the parent player of a child player in Video Cloud Studio, however, a change made to the parent player affects all child players.</li>
      <li>Publishing a parent player can take a long time if you have a lot of child players associated with that parent player. Each child player is published separately, and if you have more than 30 child players, you can expect some delays in your child player publishing. This would be exactly the same case as publishing 30 regular players at the same time.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Given the reasons above, it may make sense to start with using regular players, and then trying out embeds when you see the need for child players.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="video_tag_data-embed">video tag data-embed</h2>
    
    <p>There is a notational differences in parent and child players. Standard in-page embed player code appears in this format:</p>
    
    <pre class="line-numbers">
    <code class="language-html" translate="No">&lt;video-js
      data-account="1507807800001"
      data-player="HiAdwRZ7kK"
      <span class="bcls-highlight">data-embed="default"</span>
      controls=""
      data-application-id=""
      class="vjs-fluid"&gt;&lt;/video-js&gt;</code></pre>
    
    <p>The <code translate="No">data-embed</code> attribute determines if the player is a parent or child. If the value is <code translate="No">default</code>, the player is a parent. If the player is a child, the <code translate="No">data-embed</code> attribute will contain the ID of the parent player. An example of that follows:</p>
    
    <p>The <code translate="No">data-embed</code> attribute determines if the player is a parent or child. If the value is <code translate="No">default</code>, the player is a parent. If the player is a child, the <code translate="No">data-embed</code> attribute will contain the ID of the parent player. An example of that follows:</p>

      data-player="HiAdwRZ7kK"
      <span class="bcls-highlight">data-embed="NURK56ZSV"</span>
      data-application-id=""
      class="video-js" controls&gt;&lt;/video-js&gt;</code></pre>
    
    <p>Note that the <code translate="No">data-player</code>, that is the player ID, is the same, but the <code translate="No">data-embed</code> has changed from <code translate="No">default</code> to the child player's ID.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="notation">Child player URLs</h2>
    
    <p>How do you differentiate between the parent player and child players? The URLs will be different. For example, a parent player's URL is:</p>
    
    <pre class="line-numbers">
    <code class="language-http" translate="No">//players.brightcove.net/1507807800001/HiAdwRZ7kK<span class="bcls-highlight">_default</span>/index.min.js</code></pre>
    
    <p>After using the embed APIs to create a child player, the child player's ID added to the parent's URL, as shown here:</p>
    
    <pre class="line-numbers">
    <code class="language-http" translate="No">//players.brightcove.net/1507807800001/HiAdwRZ7kK<span class="bcls-highlight">_NURK56ZSV</span>/index.min.js</code></pre>
    </section>
    
    <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="why">Parent/child use case</h2>
    
    <p>Assume you use multiple video players. Often, the common features of the players are very nearly the same, but in a few instances you want to tweak the player for special cases. You could create multiple players using the Player Configuration APIs with <code translate="No">POST</code> and <code translate="No">PATCH</code> methods, but this could lead to significant maintenance issues. For instance, say you wanted to change the poster for all the players. This would mean using <code translate="No">PATCH</code> on all the different players. Whereas if you created child players, you would only <code translate="No">PATCH</code> the parent player, and all the child players would automatically have the new poster.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="creationprocess">Creation process</h2>
    
    <p>If you have done the <a href="/player-management/getting-started/step-step-player-management.html">Step-by-Step: Player Management</a> you have seen the process of using curl statements to communicate HTTP methods to the Player Management API. The same approach will be used here.</p>
    
    <p>To create a player you have most likely used a few HTTP methods with the Player Configuration APIs, such as:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Create the player using a <code translate="No">POST</code> to <em>https://players.api.brightcove.com/v2/accounts/{account_id}/players</em></li>
      <li>Update the player using a <code translate="No">PATCH</code> to <em>https://players.api.brightcove.com/v2/accounts/{account_id}/players/{player_id}/configuration</em></li>
      <li>Publish the updated player using a <code translate="No">POST</code> to <em>https://players.api.brightcove.com/v2/accounts/{account_id}/players/{player_id}/publish</em></li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>A similar approach will be used for child players using the embed APIs. At a very high level you will:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Create a child player using a <code translate="No">POST</code> to <em>https://players.api.brightcove.com/v2/accounts/{account_id}/players/{player_id}/<strong>embeds</strong></em>. Note: Child players created with the embed APIs self publish on creation so there is no need to publish on child player creation, only on child player update.</li>
      <li>Update the child player using a <code translate="No">PATCH</code> to <em>https://players.api.brightcove.com/v2/accounts/{account_id}/players/{player_id}/<strong>embeds/$EMBED_ID/configuration</strong></em></li>
      <li>Publish the child player using a <code translate="No">POST</code> to <em>https://players.api.brightcove.com/v2/accounts/{account_id}/players/{player_id}/<strong>embeds/$EMBED_ID/publish</strong></em></li>
    </ul>
